       " 'Sinclar Broadcast Group also operates Chillicothe-licensed, CW-affiliated WWHO (channel 53), through a shared services agreement with Manhan Media.',\n",
       " \"The three stations share studios on Dublin Road in Grandview Heights, a suburb of Columbus; WTTE and WSYX also share a transmitter on Columbus' west side.\",\n",
       " '========,2,History.',\n",
       " 'WTTE began operations on June 1, 1984 as the first general-entertainment independent station in central Ohio.',\n",
       " 'The station was founded by the Commercial Radio Institute, a subsidiary of the Baltimore-based Sinclair Broadcast Group.',\n",
       " 'WTTE quickly became the dominant independent station in the area largely because its programming policy was far less conservative than that of the other independent in the area, Christian-oriented, Newark-licensed WSFJ-TV (channel 51).',\n",
       " 'Channel 28 is a charter affiliate of Fox, having joined the network at its launch on October 9, 1986.',\n",
       " 'From 1995 until 1997, it carried a secondary affiliation with UPN which was then picked up by WWHO.',\n",
       " 'In 1996, Sinclair merged with River City Broadcasting, owner of WSYX.',\n",
       " 'Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules at the time did not allow one person to own two stations in a single market.',\n",
       " 'Sinclair kept the longer-established WSYX and nominally sold WTTE to Glencairn, Ltd. owned by former Sinclair executive Edwin Edwards.',\n",
       " \"However, nearly all of Glencairn's stock was held by the Smith family, founders and owners of Sinclair.\",\n",
       " 'In effect, Sinclair still owned WTTE, and now had a duopoly in Columbus in violation of FCC rules.',\n",
       " \"Sinclair and Glencairn further circumvented the rules by moving WTTE's operations into WSYX' studios under a local marketing agreement, with WSYX as senior partner.\",\n",
       " 'Glencairn owned ten other stations—all in markets where Sinclair also had a station.',\n",
       " 'Sinclair was eventually fined $40,000 for its illegal control of Glencairn.',\n",
       " 'The two companies attempted to merge in 2001 after the FCC allowed duopolies.',\n",
       " 'However, the FCC would not allow Sinclair to repurchase WTTE.',\n",
       " 'The FCC does not allow duopolies between two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market.',\n",
       " 'Also the Columbus market, despite its relatively large size, has only seven full-power stations—too few to legally permit a duopoly.',\n",
       " 'WTTE thus remained under the banner of Glencairn, which was then renamed Cunningham Broadcasting.',\n",
       " \"However, the Smith family still controls nearly all of Cunningham's stock, so Sinclair still effectively has a duopoly in Columbus.\",\n",
       " 'By nearly all accounts, Sinclair has used Glencairn / Cunningham as a shell corporation to evade FCC ownership rules.',\n",
       " 'In 2006, all Sinclair-controlled Fox affiliates including WTTE extended their affiliation contracts until at least March 2012.',\n",
       " 'WTTE-DT2 was formerly an affiliate of The Tube, a 24-hour digital music channel.',\n",
       " 'Like other Sinclair-owned stations, this was dropped in January 2007, due to a disagreement between Sinclair and The Tube over E/I programming.',\n",
       " 'The network ceased operations that October due to the lack of advertising.',\n",
       " 'According to Nielsen Media Research in the May 2011 ratings period, WTTE was the 2nd most watched Fox affiliate in the United States in prime time.',\n",
       " \"The station remains intensely competitive in the Columbus television market with it remaining an extremely strong competitor against WBNS-TV and WCMH-TV averaging roughly 300,000 viewers each night during the station's 10 o'clock newscast despite its earlier time slot.\",\n",
       " 'WTTE typically wins the demographic viewership battle each and every ratings period.',\n",
       " 'The demographic win is a much sought after attribute for television sales associates in the area for local advertising purposes.',\n",
       " 'On October 18, 2010, the station reactivated their 28.2 digital subchannel for the first time since December 2006, with theCoolTV, a music video network which, unlike The Tube, had E/I programming pre-inserted as part of their national schedule.',\n",
       " 'The network was discontinued as of August 31, 2012.',\n",
       " \"WTTE is also considered an alternate ABC affiliate airing that network's programs when WSYX is unable to do so such as during a breaking news emergency or local special.\",\n",
       " \"On May 15, 2012, Sinclair and Fox agreed to a five-year extension to the network's affiliation agreement with the 19 Fox stations owned or controlled by Sinclair, including WTTE, allowing them to continue carrying the network's programming through 2017.\",\n",
       " 'On June 23, 2014, Sinclair signed a deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment to carry the GetTV network as a subchannel on 33 of their stations; WTTE was one such station, and the 28.2 subchannel was reactivated.',\n",
       " \"On June 1, 2017, Sinclair replaced GetTV with TBD (TV network) on WTTE's 28.2 subchannel.\",\n",

       " \"The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 36, using PSIP to display WTTE's virtual channel as 28 on digital television receivers.\",\n",
       " 'However, until March 3, as part of the SAFER Act, analog channel 28 aired a repeating loop of a short informational film (in both English and Spanish) about the DTV changeover and how to upgrade to digital television.',\n",
