========,1,preface.
The First European Air Traffic Controller Selection Test (FEAST) is a tool that helps Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) to identify the most suitable candidates for the job of air traffic controllers.
FEAST has been designed by and made available by (EUROCONTROL), the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation.
It is currently used by 44 organisations.
These are:
***LIST***.
========,2,Structure.
The FEAST test package consists of 3 modules:
***LIST***.
Tests are administered in a standardized way and all results are scored by computer.
This is done to ensure the objectivity of the process.
The first phase of FEAST aims at measuring basic skills and abilities in decision-making, logical reasoning, visual perception, attention, multi-tasking and spatial orientation.
This phase also includes a test on English language knowledge.
All parts of the FEAST I consist of multiple choice questions.
Once the candidate has successfully passed the FEAST I tests, she/he may be invited to attend a second round of testing.
In this second phase she/he will do one or two work sample tests:
***LIST***.
These tests are aimed at measuring the multi-tasking abilities.
The tests are more complex and will require the candidates to perform a number of different tasks at the same time like in the job of an Air Traffic Controller.
The third phase of FEAST consists in the assessment of personality traits and behavioral tendencies.
The exact content of this phase will differ between organizations that use FEAST.
========,2,Content.
Nearly all parts of the FEAST test consist of multiple choice questions.
The test contains questions related to the following:
***LIST***.
The 1st part is to listen to a sentence, which is interrupted with a beep-tone.
Applicants then choose the word (from the choice offered) which is the closest in meaning to the sentence.
The 2nd part is the “whole comprehension” of English.
Candidates must read 2 texts with 2 different topics.
The first text deals with the relationship between bosses and employees within a firm, particularly with the question how to deal with errors, made by the employees and how to distinguish between "punishable" and "non punishable" errors, respectively "avoidable" and "non avoidable" errors and how to cope with them by maintaining a good working atmosphere.
The second text is about the relationship between companies and media, particularly how to maintain the companies´ public reputation through a media council.
Finally at the 3rd part, one must listen to a telephone conversation, which is about booking a train ticket: The scheduling, particularly the times and the prices of the ticket are often changed and in progress of the conversation, one must remember all data (cancelled as well as topical scheduling times, prices and so on).
***LIST***.
The 2nd part of this is the same as the 1st, but instead using numbers rather than shapes.
For example, when the number 48 is displayed, it must be sorted into one category - this would be sorted into “0-250”.
However, this exercise also develops as time passes; for example, if the sum of the digits of the number displayed is greater than 10, or if a particular digit appears twice in the given number, it must be sorted as if it were in the category “250-500”, and so forth.
***LIST***.
Here ends the first part of the test, if national air traffic control organisations split it into two parts (see above).
***LIST***.
Some air traffic control organisations now add additional tests, for example a special reaction test or detection of a figure (a house) out of a muddle of lines.
========,2,Preparation for FEAST.
The tests are demanding in terms of concentration.
Resilience and perseverance are required.
Therefore, EUROCONTROL advises that the candidates should only attend the testing in a good physical and mental condition.
EUROCONTROL discourages specific test preparation; however, there are some general areas in which the candidates can prepare themselves: 
***LIST***.
FEAST tests are designed for beginners with no background in ATC.
The tests instructions are very detailed and ensure that everything is explained before the tests start.
========,2,Result.
A result is given directly after the test, or via a letter, e-mail or phone call.
These results are computed by the central computer of Eurocontrol in Brussels (each candidate is connected with this computer via internet).
The score required to proceed to the next round of selection differs from one air traffic control organisation to another.
If a candidate has already successfully participated in a FEAST test, Eurocontrol offers a special certificate for trying it again elsewhere.
Each company has a different opinion of whether an applicant is allowed to try the test again or not.
According to the rules of Eurocontrol, unsuccessful applicants must wait 2 years before a second attempt.
========,2,Criticism and commendation of the FEAST test.
Although 44 member states of Eurocontrol use the FEAST test, it is not as popular elsewhere.
The reason for this is that, until January 2015, the test could only be provided to ANSPs and ATC training academies in Eurocontrol member states.
A particular criticism of the FEAST test refers to the English part of the FEAST test: some national air traffic control organisations add (after a successful FEAST test) an oral English test (a conversation with a native English speaking air traffic controller).
The results of this oral English test are equivalent to the so-called "ICAO Level 4 English Knowledge Requirement"[1], which every pilot and air traffic controller must have.
People who obtain relatively low scores in the English part of the FEAST test often pass this second English test easily and one can doubt how objective the English part of the FEAST test actually is.
On the other hand, the FEAST test is seen to be a very fair test: if this test is taken directly at Eurocontrol, all travel expenses and costs of hotels are reimbursed, as far as the applicant's residence is out of an area of 50 km from the Maastricht upper area control centre.
Everyone, especially those of poorer member-countries of Eurocontrol, has a fair and realistic chance.
Excessively so, no specific knowledge of mathematics or physics are required.
Psychological "pre-selections" do not exist either.
Applicants from all member countries of Eurocontrol are encouraged to participate and since the systems of education of each of the member states are rather different, Eurocontrol sets the priority of the FEAST test on basic skills.
Additionally, unlike some other national air traffic control organisations, multiple attempts are possible.
