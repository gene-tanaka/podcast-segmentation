"The Missing Ring" is a fantasy adventure game with a similar premise to the "Dungeons & Dragons" role-playing game seriesâ€”a band of adventurers, which may include humans, elves, dwarves or wizards, enters an enchanted palace to seek treasure and slay enemies.
The ultimate objective is to find a wizard's ancient ring.

Before play begins, the player selects an adventuring party to send into the map.
The party may include up to five characters drawn from the following nine classes:
***LIST***.
The player may also visit the "merchant" and spend gold to equip the characters with such things as healing potions.
Once the party is assembled, the player selects one of ten different maps to explore and play begins.
Though one player can control all the characters, the game can also be played with multiple players, each controlling a single character in the party.
Characters appear as small, white silhouettes, and move through rooms rendered as perspective line drawings.
A header at the top of the screen indicates the room being shown, and a footer gives details about the active character, including his level, health and experience.
The game is controlled by pressing keys on the computer's keyboard.
Two complete sets of controls are arranged at either end of the keyboard, allowing two people to play simultaneously without having to trade off.
The key assignments are:
========,2,Reception.
In 1984 "Softline" readers named the game the eighth-worst Apple program of 1983.
Datamost had a kid do the copy protection for this game and most of the discs failed to run.
I had 7 out of 10 that I had to return to datamost due to that.
The game wasn't meant to be a big game changer; it was developed as a mid range game between Ultima and Wizardry, two of the big sellers at the time.
