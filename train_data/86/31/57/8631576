========,2,History.
UnCabaret was created by performance artist-turned comedian Beth Lapides whose frustration with the comedy club scene of the late 1980s in the Los Angeles lead her to seek 'a better way'.
She began producing shows in 'alternative' venues and in 1988 with writer-producer Greg Miller launched UnCabaret at The Women's Building.
In November 1993, UnCabaret was booked for three nights at LunaPark, a new music club in West Hollywood.
Every Sunday night for the next seven years, Beth gathered a group of performers culled from the very best and brightest comedians, including Patton Oswalt, Judy Toll, Taylor Negron, Bob Odenkirk, Julia Sweeney, Bobcat Goldthwait, Terry Sweeney, Merrill Markoe, Janeane Garofalo, David Cross, Laura Kightlinger, Andy Kindler, Dana Gould, Kathy Griffin, Andy Dick, Margaret Cho, Michael Patrick King, to develop an idiosyncratic story based form of stand-up.
The idea of the show was to be funny without doing an 'act' and use story-based stream-of-consciousness techniques rather than the set-up and punchline formula of mainstream standup.
Traditional comedians dismissed UnCabaret for its lack of structure and formal technique, but the show drew a rabid cult following and influenced many other 'alternative comedy' shows in Los Angeles, then New York and eventually throughout the country and Canada.
In 1997, Comedy Central produced an UnCabaret TV special hosted by Beth Lapides and featuring Taylor Negron, Dana Gould, Julia Sweeney, Kathy Griffin, Andy Dick and Scott Thompson.
When LunaPark closed, UnCabaret moved to the HBO Workspace (where they developed the show with Warner Bros), then to The Knitting Factory and M-Bar always continuing to produce personal narrative comedy with an expanding group of non-traditional comedians Sklar Brothers, Patton Oswalt, Greg Behrendt, Jeff Garlin, Mike McDonald, plus writers like Jerry Stahl, Michael Patrick King, Larry Charles, Judd Apatow, John Riggi and others.
UnCabaret went on an extended hiatus in 2008.
In 2012, Beth brought UnCabaret back.
Teaming up with Musical Director and producer Mitch Kaplan, Beth refined the show, and began to mix a new crop of comedians with many of the performers who had constituted UnCabaret in its previous incarnations.
Among the musicians and comedians who have appeared at First and Hope are Sarah Silverman, Roseanne Barr, Sandra Bernhard, Tig Notaro, Rory Scovel, Kyle Kinane, Tim Bagley, Michaela Watkins, Laura Kightlinger, Jackie Kashian, Byron Bowers, Moshe Kasher, Miss Coco Peru, Rebecca Corry, Moon Zappa, Natasha Leggero, Michelle Lee, Rae Dawn Chong, Andy Kindler, Eddie Pepitone, Marc Maron, Kurt Braunohler, Jennifer Coolidge, Jen Kirkman, Julie Goldman, Lauren Weedman, Allee Willis, Missi Pyle, Sam Pancake, Drew Droege, Karen Kilgariff, Greg Behrendt, Rob Delaney, Jill Sobule, Kelly Carlin, Ruby Friedman, Ben Gleib, Abby Travis, Lynda Kay, conniekim, Richard Chamberlain, and Kelly Mantle.
