========,1,preface.
The Beretta BM 59 is an Italian-made rifle based on the M1 Garand rifle, but chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO, and modified to use a detachable magazine.
Later revisions incorporated other features common to more modern rifles.
========,2,Development.
After World War II, Italy adopted the US-designed M1 Garand rifle in .30-06 Springfield (7.62×63mm) and also manufactured it under license.
This semi-automatic rifle proved itself well during World War II, but in the late 1950s it was considered outdated and obsolete and the Italian military also wanted a new rifle chambered for the NATO-standard 7.62×51mm round.
To meet these requirements, Beretta designed the BM 59, which was essentially a rechambered M1 fitted with a removable 20-round magazine, folding bipod and a combined muzzle brake/flash suppressor/rifle grenade launcher.
The BM 59 is capable of selective fire.
The BM 59 was adopted in 1959 and served with Italian, Argentinian, Indonesian, and Moroccan armies.
In the early 1980s, semi-automatic versions were imported to the United States and sold to private collectors.
The earliest BM 59s were manufactured from U.S.-manufactured M1 parts, including re-chambered barrels.
In 1990, the BM 59 was replaced in Italian service by the Beretta AR70/90 assault rifles, although some may be in service in the Italian Navy.
