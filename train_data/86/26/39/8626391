========,1,preface.
Tsakhur (Tsaxur, Caxur) (Russian: цахурский) is a language spoken by the Tsakhurs in northern Azerbaijan and southwestern Dagestan (Russia).
It is spoken by about 13,000 people in Azerbaijan and by about 9,770 people in Dagestan.
The word "Tsakhur" derives from the name of a Dagestani village where speakers of this language make up the majority.
Although Tsakhur is endangered in communities in closest contact with Azerbaijani, it is vigorous in other communities, gaining prominence in the region, seen in the growth of interest in learning Tsakhur in school and a growing body of Tsakhur-learning materials.
Tsakhur is classified as "definitely endangered" by UNESCO's Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger.
========,2,Classification.
Tsakhur belongs to the Lezgic group of the Northeast Caucasian language family.
The Tsakhurs call their language C'aiχna miz.
========,2,History.
The first written documentation of Tsakhur dates back to 1895 and is attributed to Roderich von Erckert.
The first description of Tsakhur grammar was published by Adolf Dirr in 1913.
In the 1930s, a literary form of Tsakhur was developed.
Starting from 1934, the language was taught in primary schools in Azerbaijan and Dagestan.
In 1938, the use of literary Tsakhur in Azerbaijan was discontinued but regained its status in 1989.
The Tsakhur alphabet in Azerbaijan is based on the Latin script, whereas in Dagestan the language uses Cyrillic.
In the past (as early as the 11th century) there have been attempts to write Tsakhur in the Arabic script.
In 2008, Arif Rustamov directed the first and so far only feature film in Tsakhur called "Facing Back to the Qibla".
