The Church of St. Joseph in Greenwich Village is a Roman Catholic parish church located at 365 Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) at the corner of Washington Place in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.
Built in 1833â€“34, it is the oldest church in New York City specifically built to be a Roman Catholic sanctuary.
========,2,History.
St. Joseph's Parish was founded by Bishop John Dubois in 1829.
At the time St. Joseph's Parish began, the population of New York, numbering 203,000, was concentrated in the southern half of Manhattan.
The parish boundaries stretched from Canal Street to 20th Street, and from Broadway to the Hudson River.
Early church records indicate that St. Joseph's first congregants were predominantly Irish-Americans.
St. Joseph's was the sixth parish to be established in Manhattan, among those still in existence in the Archdiocese of New York.
Parishes that preceded it were St. Peter's on Barclay Street (1785), St. Patrick's Old Cathedral on Mulberry Street (1809), St. James on Oliver Street (1827) and Transfiguration on Mott Street (1827).
The cornerstone of the Church was laid on June 10, 1833.
The church was designed by John Doran in the Greek Revival style,> but it has been extensively renovated over the years.
Two fires, one in 1855 and the other in 1885, caused extensive damage to the interior.
Renovations after the second fire were supervised by Arthur Crooks.
The interior of the church was restored in 1972.
At the time, a fresco of the Transfiguration, after Raphael's original in the Vatican, was discovered under layers of paint and restored.
Structural restoration work was performed in 1991 and 1992.
When then-pastor Aldo Tos retired in 2003, the Archdiocese of New York asked the Dominican Order's Province of St Joseph, which was already staffing the nearby Catholic Center at New York University, to assume the responsibility of staffing priests for the parish.
The result was a merger of the parish with NYU's Catholic Center in December 2003.
========,2,The church today.
The Catholic Center provides a wide spectrum of activities, programs, lectures and outreach programs.
It is the center of five New York University (NYU) student clubs and for five groups of students and non-students.
In addition to its campus ministry and other missions, the parish has been hosting a soup kitchen on Saturdays continuously since the 1980s.
