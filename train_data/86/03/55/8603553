========,3,Guide To Sinema.
In early 2011, the ABC commissioned a six-part series for ABC2.
The series was subtitled "The Guide To Sinema", with each episode devoted to a different cinematic sin: Violence, Sex, Money, Profanity, Drugs and Fame.
The series began on 29 September, airing Thursday nights at 9pm.
The series included appearances from Shaun Micallef, Kat Stewart, David Stratton, Tony Martin, Francis Greenslade, Julia Zemiro, John Safran, Bryan Dawe, Michael Ward, Luke Hemsworth, Abe Forsythe, Marc Fennell and Stephanie Bendixsen.
========,2,On Australian Community TV.
The show originally aired on Australian community television stations (Channel 31 Melbourne, 31 Brisbane, Television Sydney and C31 Adelaide) on 7 December 2006.
It ran for three seasons, ending on 18 December 2008.
It was nominated for multiple Antenna Awards, and won Best Comedy Program and Best Director in 2007, and Best Arts Program in both 2007 and 2008.
Every episode began with a pre-title sequence in which hosts Shannon Marinko and Lee Zachariah parodied a classic film scene.
There would then be a news segment, a feature story (either informational or a comedic sketch), an interview with a key figure movie figure, then reviews of that week's releases.
========,3,Opening Sequences.
These sequences are not strictly parodies, but rather hosts Shannon and Lee finding themselves in situations that closely resemble famous scenes.
Notable openings included the season one finale "The Graduate" (in which the wedding is attended by all the characters from the previous opening sequences), season two's "On the Town" (in which Marinko and Zachariah "sung" New York, New York with lyrics pertaining to the Melbourne International Film Festival), the season two finale "Back to the Future Part II" (in which they travelled back through time, appearing in that season's previous opening sequences), "Plan 9 from Outer Space" (featuring one of the final on-screen appearances of legendary Australian actor Bud Tingwell), "Full Metal Jacket" (in which their heads were shaved on-screen), and the series finale "Fight Club" (in which, rather than doing a single scene, the entire film was acted out).
