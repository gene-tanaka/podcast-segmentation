The Lincoln MKR concept car was a premium 4-door fastback sedan design, as introduced during the 2007 North American International Auto Show by Lincoln.
Its chassis was based on the Ford D2C platform as used in the Ford Mustang.
The MKR signaled the next-generation of premium Lincoln vehicles, introducing the new TwinForce engine family and a restyled "bow wave" waterfall grill.
The concept car was first unveiled to the media and the public in a press release on 1 January 2007.
========,2,Concept.
The Lincoln concept featured an independent rear suspension, with MacPherson Struts up front.
The engine selected for the MKR concept introduced the new generation of Ford twin-turbocharged engines.
The prototype TwinForce 3.5L twin-turbo, direct-injection gasoline V6 was also capable of running on E85 ethanol, producing up to 415-hp, and of torque.
The interior design included environmentally-friendly and renewable materials, such as cashmere leather, oak instrument panel engineered from recycled wood, mohair carpet, and seat cushion foam made from soy.
The concept car also featured the THX II-certified car audio system.
The Lincoln MKR concept was introduced along with what became Lincoln's flagship sedan, the Lincoln MKS.

Special Projects Inc., located in Plymouth, Michigan, was hired to be responsible for the building of the MKR.
Special Projects has built many other concept vehicles for Ford including Ford 427, Ford Super Chief, Ford Flex, and Lincoln Blackwood.
========,2,Production intent.
To date, Ford has not announced a production version of the MKR, although many of the concept's design themes and features were adopted for the production Lincoln MKS, MKZ, MKX, and MKT vehicles, starting with the 2009 model year MKS, 2010 for the MKZ and MKT, and 2011 for the MKX.
The Lincoln C concept also shares design themes with the MKR, in a smaller compact platform.
If the MKR had been approved, as an all new vehicle it would have likely been scheduled to launch around the 2011 time frame, most likely having been assembled at Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Flat Rock, Michigan alongside the Mustang, with which it would have shared a platform.
