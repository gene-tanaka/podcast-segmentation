Hanrahan was born in Des Moines, Iowa, USA.
He attended Norwalk High School in Norwalk, Iowa.
After graduating, he turned down a scholarship to play baseball at the University of Nebraska and entered the 2000 Major League Baseball draft.
At that time, he was ranked as the 70th-best prospect in the nation by "Baseball America.
"As profiled in "The Des Moines Register", while in second grade in Gainesville, Florida, Hanrahan was asked by his teacher what he wanted to be when he grew up.
After he responded with "a Major League ballplayer", the teacher suggested he work on a backup plan.
"I think that's what every kid says in elementary school.
Nobody ever believes it, but it's something I said, and that's what I tried to work for."
He married Kim Donovan in January 2012.

On November 14, 2014, he signed a minor league contract with the Detroit Tigers.
On March 4, 2015, Hanrahan was released by the Tigers after being diagnosed with a tear of the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow, requiring him to undergo another Tommy John surgery.

On February 22, 2017, it was announced that Hanrahan will be the assistant pitching coach to the Class A West Virginia Black Bears.
The team is the short season Class A team of the Pittsburgh Pirates.
========,2,Scouting report.
Hanrahan threw two pitches exclusively: a very quick four-seam fastball (96–99 mph) and a slider in the upper 80s.
The radar gun at Great American Ball Park once clocked him at 102 mph during a game.
His fastball is his primary pitch, and the one he throws most often in every count except 1–2.
Hanrahan's pitching style changed dramatically following the transition to the bullpen.
In 2007, his velocity was about five miles per hour lower across the board than it is now.
He also made frequent use of a changeup in the low 80s against left-handed hitters.
His fastball speed grew considerably in 2008, and by 2010 he had stopped throwing the changeup altogether.
