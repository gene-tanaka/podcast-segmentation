========,2,Allegations of sexual assault.
On 5 October 2010, Seraphim (Storheim) stepped down for three months pending an investigation by Winnipeg police.
A written report filed by a clergyman with the national church in fall 2008 alleged that Storheim had sexually assaulted two 10-year-old boys between 1984 and 1987.
The New York headquarters of the church issued a press release in October 2010 saying that Storheim was being investigated after a complaint of "misconduct" from about 25 years before.
It is also reported that Storheim sent a letter of apology to the two alleged victims.
A preliminary hearing was held on 17 November 2011 to determine whether there was sufficient evidence for the case to proceed to trial; the archbishop pleaded not guilty.
A court-ordered ban prevented specific details from being published.
In October 2015, Storheim was demoted to a monk and resides at an OCA facility following his release from prizon.
