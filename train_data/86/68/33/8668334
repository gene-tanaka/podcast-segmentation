Two of Freeman's books have drawn notice from the academic community.
Freeman's 1988 book, "In Transit: The Transport Workers Union in New York City, 1933-1966", won the Philip Taft Labor History Book Award in 1989.
The book was widely reviewed and praised for unearthing the history of a radical union important in the history of the American labor movement.
Freeman's 2000 book, "Working-Class New York: Life and Labor Since World War II", also won positive reviews.
Freeman intended that the book correct histories of New York City which focused on wealthy elites, elected leaders and organizations.
Throughout the first half of the book, Freeman argues that everyday workers were at least as influential as these other groups in making New York City into a progressive bastion and world economic and cultural center.
Freeman One critic argued that Freeman too easily dismissed conservative and anti-communist forces active in New York City at the time, wasting a chance to explain why leftist labor unions were able to overcome them and implement much of their agenda.
Freeman's most recent book is "American Empire, 1945-2000: The Rise of a Global Power, The Democratic Revolution at Home".
It is part of the "Penguin History of the United States", edited by Eric Foner.
