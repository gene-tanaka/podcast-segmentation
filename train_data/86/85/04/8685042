========,2,History.
Dongdaemun District was first created in 1943 when the "gu" system started and was larger in area than today.
Seongbuk District separated from the district in 1949, and Changsin Dong and Sungin Dong were given to Jongno District in 1975.
An additional 17 "dong" (neighborhoods) separated to become Jungnang District in 1988.
========,2,Geography.
Dongdaemun District borders Seongbuk District to the north-west, Jungnang District to the east (with the Jungnangcheon stream forming the border), Gwangjin District to the south-east, Seongdong District to the south, meets Jung District at a point in the south-west and borders Jongno District to the west.
The busiest neighbourhood of the district is the Cheongnyangni area - a large commercial zone formed around Cheongnyangni Station, one of the secondary CBDs of Seoul.
Dongdaemun District is named after the east gate in Seoul's city walls, Dongdaemun, but Dongdaemun itself is actually located in Jongno District.
This is due to an administrative border change.
