========,1,preface.
Flixster is an American social movie site for discovering new movies, learning about movies, and meeting others with similar tastes in movies.
The site allows users to view movie trailers as well as learn about the new and upcoming movies in the box office.
The site is based in San Francisco, California and was founded by Joe Greenstein and Saran Chari in 2007.
Flixster has been the parent of website Rotten Tomatoes since January 2010.
Flixster, including Rotten Tomatoes, was acquired by Fandango on February 17, 2016.
========,2,History.
In February 2016, Fandango acquired Flixster.
Fandango began migrating Flixster Video users to its competing service called FandangoNow and will close the Flixster Video service.
========,2,Site information.
Between November 2006 and January 2007, the number of daily page views by Alexa Toolbar users rose from fewer than 20 million per day to around 50 million per day.
Alexa no longer (June 2008) provides numbers of daily page views, but the number of page views as a percentage decreased by almost two thirds from mid-December 2007 to mid-June 2008.
Quantcast reports that the number of global daily page views for Flixster.com peaked at 8,331,961 on January 23, 2008 and dropped to 1,325,685 by July 5, 2008.
Flixster's Facebook application, called "Movies", has consistently been one of the most popular apps on the site.
Daily user totals peaked in December 2007.
Flixster Collections, a desktop application featuring a content discovery and management system, began open beta testing on July 29, 2011.
This was a common trend among Facebook applications, attributed to what has been described as "app fatigue".
Facebook no longer displays daily active use, but instead monthly active use.
As of September 2010, its popularity has waned significantly, and its 2.98 million monthly active users place the Movies app as the #9 most-used entertainment application on Facebook, but ranked at only #92 overall.
========,2,Marketing practices.
Flixster's growth has been described in the trade press as attributable to "its aggressive viral marketing practices", including "the automated selection of your email account's entire address book in order to send a Flixster invitation to all of your contacts."
Although Flixster claims this procedure is an industry standard used by other services, Flixster differs in that their system automatically selects all contacts in the user's address book and requires the user to manually un-select each address individually to prevent email from being sent in the user's name.
Co-Founder Joe Greenstein has described the difference between Flixster and other sites as: "We make it easy to invite your friends.
Other sites don't provide good ways for people to spread the word."
As a consequence of its policy of emailing users' entire address books with advertisements for the site, the website has been criticized on numerous Internet blogs.
At one time email from Flixster to Hotmail users was being filtered and deleted as spam.
Around August 2012, the Flixster website stopped allowing public access.
Viewers must log in using a free account or Facebook.
