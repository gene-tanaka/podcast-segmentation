========,2,Etymology.
While the name Kumbhasi is said to be derived from Kumbhasura, who was slain here.
The story behind the name goes like this….
Long ago when this area was hit by drought, sage Agasthya came here to perform yagna to please the rain god.
During that time the demon Kumbhasura tried to disrupt the yagna by troubling sages performing the yagna.
To rescue the sages Lord Ganesha blessed Bheema, the strongest among the Pandavas(In their exile period) with a sword, using which Bheema killed the demon and facilitated the completion of the yagna.
Hence the name Kumbashi.
The name Anegudde comes from Aane (elephant) and Gudde (hillock), as it is the abode of the elephant-headed god, Sri Vinayaka.
