========,2,Starfishing.
This is Monaghan’s second novel, and was published by Chatto and Windus in March 2008.
It is based in the City of London in the late 1990s and is about Frankie Cavanagh, a LIFFE futures trader, working and playing hard and trying to keep up with the boys.
She starts an affair with her boss, Tom, and the two go down a destructive route together.
The book is dark, with gothic overtones, and some very subtle references to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.
As with Monaghan's previous work, the imagery is rich and very sensual, and the narrative fast paced.
The story takes place as the financial world begins to be taken over by electronic trading on screens and traders struggle to cope with this transition,
========,2,The Okinawa Dragon.
Monaghan's third book is a short novella published by Five Leaves Publications, also in 2008.

He's the ultimate alpha male with high powered customers all over the world.
One of Jack's richest clients wants to own a very rare trading card, The Okinawa Dragon but it belongs to a Japanese businessman who isn't prepared to sell.
Jack travels to Japan to 'acquire' the card.
