The Grand Slambovians, a.k.a.
The Slambovian Circus of Dreams is a Hudson Valley, New York based band, which was founded in Sleepy Hollow in 1998.
The band's music is a form of folk rock and is sometimes described as "Hillbilly Pink Floyd," or "Punk Classical Hillbilly Floyd."
Their latest album, "A Box of Everything", was released April 1, 2014, on the Red River Entertainment label.
The band regularly plays the major folk music venues, clubs, theaters, and music festivals in the Northeastern, and East North Central United States and Canada often to sold out crowds.
They also tour in other regions of the United States, including California and Florida.
In August 2008 they made their first appearance outside of North America, at the Rhythm Festival in England.
Their reception there was so enthusiastic that they were invited back for the 2009 festival, as well as several other UK festivals in the summer of 2009.
The band performed at Glastonbury Festival in 2010 and toured the UK in subsequent years.
The flavor of the band is best captured by a live concert, or by one of their live recordings.
The band is noted for the dedication and support shown by their fans.
Some fans travel hundreds of miles to attend concerts.
A high point of the year for many fans are the Grand Slambovian Hillbilly Pirate Balls, annual costumed events held in London and New York in the run-up to Halloween.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s Joziah, Tink, and Sharkey were members of a progressive rock band called The Ancestors, which released 3 albums.
***LIST***.
Tracks on Brigadoon were produced by Eddie Kramer.
Other members of The Ancestors included Bob Muller (of the Trey Gunn Band), and Alistair Farrant.
The Ancestors had some degree of success but the band broke up in 1995, and they took a hiatus from the music industry.
During that hiatus Joziah and Tink took courses in computer graphic design and video production at the Westchester Arts Workshop and met Tony Zuzulo, who was one of their instructors.
In 1998 they formed The Circus and added Tony when they discovered that he had been a bar band drummer.
