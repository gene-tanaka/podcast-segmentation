========,1,preface.
Challenge of the Superfriends is an American animated television series about a team of superheroes which ran from September 9, 1978, to December 23, 1978, on ABC.
The complete series (16 episodes) was produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions for Warner Bros. Television and is based on the Justice League and associated comic book characters published by DC Comics and created by Julius Schwartz, Gardner Fox and Mike Sekowsky.
It was the third series of "Super Friends" cartoons, following the original "Super Friends" in 1973 and "The All-New Super Friends Hour" in 1977.
It continues to air on Boomerang from Cartoon Network in the United States until February 2, 2009.
========,2,Format.
========,3,First segment.
As originally aired, this season consisted of two half-hour segments.
The first of these featured the Legion of Doom, a team of thirteen recurring foes, the Super Friends' worst enemies.
Every episode would feature battles between the thirteen supervillains of the Legion of Doom and the eleven superheroes of the Justice League of America.
The Legion of Doom dwelled in a murky swamp and launched their attacks for global conquest from a sinister looking, swamp-based, mechanical flying headquarters called the Hall of Doom as a suitable contrast with the Super Friends' gleaming Hall of Justice.
========,3,Second segment.
The second segment of this season was an adventure with Superman, Batman and Robin, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and the Wonder Twins, similar to those that had aired the previous season in "The All-New Super Friends Hour".
Thanks to these episodes being shown using the opening credits of the "All-New Super Friends Hour" in syndication, the second segment along being used with the "Challenge of Super Friends" opening, and confused references to the show it is often mistakenly believed that the first and second segments were two separate shows.
========,2,Production background.
========,3,Early development.
When the Challenge of the Super Friends season was originally conceived, it was named "Battle of the Superheroes" and featured the introduction of Captain Marvel to the Super Friends.
The group that challenged the heroes was called the "League of Evil", led by Marvel's nemesis Doctor Sivana.
However, Filmation produced Shazam!
and The New Adventures of Batman which prevented the use of characters such as Mister Atom, King Kull, Beautia Sivana, Joker, Penguin, Mr.
Freeze, and Catwoman.
Early conceptual art drawn by Alex Toth would also include Heat Wave, Poison Ivy, and Abra Kadabra.

The music supervisor was Paul DeKorte.
Character designs for this particular "Super Friends" series were done by Andre LeBlanc.

These characters were created to add racial and cultural diversity to the show (this was also mentioned in some of the episode introduction extras on the first two Challenge of the Super Friends DVDs).
