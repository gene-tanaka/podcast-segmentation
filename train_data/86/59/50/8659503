========,3,Capital area helicopter airlift.
========,4,Background.
The Air Force's use of helicopters to transport 'distinguished persons' in the Capital area go back to August 1955, when Military Air Transport Service organized the 1401st Helicopter Flight at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland.
In July 1957, a helicopter from the 1401st landed on the lawn of the White House to transport President Eisenhower, marking the unit's first presidential airlift flight.
In October 1957, the flight was transferred to Headquarters Command, which required renumbering it as the 1001st Helicopter Flight.
The flight moved to Bolling Air Force Base in 1963.
Expanding demands for helicopter airlift resulted in the flight expanding to the 1001st Helicopter Squadron.
On 7 September 1968 the 1001st returned its operations to Andrews.
The squadron received the Air Force's flying safety award in 1963.
In 1966, it dropped supplies to snowbound civilians following a blizzard.
In 1969 Headquarters Command replaced the 1001st, which was a MAJCON (four-digit) unit and could not continue its history, with a unit controlled by Headquarters, USAF, which could continue its history.
The conversion was one of unit category and number only and the new squadron would continue the mission and assume the manning and resources of the discontinuing 1001st.
The new squadron was entitled to all the awards earned by the 1001st, but not its lineage.
========,4,New squadron assumes helicopter airlift mission.
Since activation in 1969 the 1st Helicopter Squadron has provided local airlift for the Executive Department, high-ranking dignitaries, and distinguished visitors, as well as support for emergency evacuation of key government officials, search and rescue, and emergency medical evacuation.
The squadron maintains a helicopter on alert for short notice mission assignments.
In January 1983 Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into the 14th Street bridge during a blizzard.
The squadron participated in the following relief efforts despite the unfavorable weather conditions at the time.
Currently the squadron operates Bell UH-1N Huey helicopters acquired in the early 1970s.
Air Force Space Command also operates the UH-1N and has proposed the Common Vertical Lift Support Platform (CVLSP) program to seek a replacement to their UH-1Ns.
