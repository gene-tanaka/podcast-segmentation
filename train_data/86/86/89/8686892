Later poets like Keshavsuta, Balakavi, Govindagraj, and the poets of Ravi Kiran Mandal, like Madhav Julian, wrote poetry that was influenced by Romantic and Victorian English poetry, being largely sentimental and lyrical.
Prahlad Keshav Atre, a renowned satirist and politician, wrote a parody of this sort of poetry in his collection, Jhenduchi Phule.
The major paradigm shift in sensibility began in the 1940s with the avant-garde modernist poetry of BS Mardhekar.
In the mid-1950s, the 'little magazine movement' gained momentum.

It also strengthened the Dalit literary movement, and in general many poets emerged from the 'little magazine movement'.
A major change in Marathi sensibility began in the 1990s with the antipostmodern criticism and postpostmodern poems of Shridhar Tilve.
