========,2,History.
MCLC opened its doors for the first time on September 5, 2006.
Prior to its opening, the school building project was known as Central Los Angeles Area New High School #10.
The school took many students who were enrolled in Belmont High School and chose to transfer, as well as students who were unable to attend overcrowded local schools, and had been bussed to nearby schools throughout their entire academic careers.
The three Small Learning Communities (SLCs) were originally established at Belmont High School and essentially moved their entire community (teachers and students) to the new complex.
The three SLCs were Academic Learning Complex (ALC), Business and Tourism (BT) and Social Justice (SJ).
This will be the protocol for other new schools in the area that will aim to relieve the overcrowding at Belmont as it transitions into a 6-12 school.
The total budget for this school was $161,276,500.
========,2,Neighborhoods served by Contreras.
Areas served by Contreras include portions of the Pico-Union and Westlake, Angelino Heights, Chinatown, Koreatown, Echo Park, and Little Tokyo areas.
MCLC & LASGS and Belmont share the same attendance boundary and are separate schools which are called pilot schools.
