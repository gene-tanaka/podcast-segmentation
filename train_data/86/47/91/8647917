========,1,preface.
American University of Antigua (AUA) is a for-profit medical school with a US-based curriculum.
Its basic sciences campus is located on the Caribbean island of Antigua.
Administrative headquarters are located in Manhattan, New York and it is a division of Manipal Global Education Services.
AUA confers the Doctor of Medicine degree upon its graduates.
========,2,History.
In 2004, Neal Simon, JD, co-founded American University of Antigua (AUA) College of Medicine.
Simon is also the school’s President.
========,2,Accreditations and Approvals.
Historically, it’s been more difficult for Caribbean medical schools to obtain accreditations from the various governing bodies that confer accreditations, recognition, and approval on medical schools.
As of December 2016, AUA has earned accreditation and approval from the following organizations, agencies, and departments of education.
========,2,Campus.
In January 2010, AUA opened its 17-acre (69,000 m) campus.
The $60 million facility houses more than 75,000 square feet (7,000 m) of classrooms, a simulation laboratory, a multi-story library, study rooms, an amphitheater, a courtyard, tennis courts, athletic fields, and administrative and faculty offices.
In August 2011, AUA announced plans for an $18 million expansion of the Antigua campus.
The expansion will bring the campus to a total of 27-acres.
The school’s facilities include a Simulated Learning Center, which has SimMan 3G®, SimBaby™, Harvey®, and Noelle® simulators, an Anatomy Lab that is equipped with cadavers for dissection and protection, plastinated body part specimens, models, X-rays, and CT and MRI sections, as well as computer stations with instant access to Adams Atlas, V.H.
Dissector, and prerecorded prosected demos.
Students learn Basic Life Support (BLS) and Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) at the school’s American Heart Association™ International Training Center, which was established in partnership with representatives of the Mayo Clinic.
There is also a simulated ward (The Osler Suites) on the AUA campus where students can work with standardized and professional patients to gain clinical experience before leaving Antigua to complete clinical rotations throughout the United States and Canada.
========,2,Curriculum.
Since 2010, the university has followed the two-semester academic year calendar that US medical schools follow.
The curriculum is also modeled on that of US medical schools.
AUA students complete the program in two parts: Basic Sciences and Clinical Sciences.
========,3,Basic Sciences (Years 1 and 2).
Courses follow a two-semester schedule and are taught in Antigua.
They include foundational lectures and laboratory competency courses that cover key concepts in human structure, anatomy, medical cell biology, physiology, biochemistry, genetics, clinical medicine, Emergency Medical Training, microbiology, immunology, pathology, pharmacology, behavioral science, and neuroscience.
The purpose of this component of the MD Program is to prepare students for Clinical Sciences where they will apply what they’ve learned in a hospital setting.
During Basic Sciences students must take and pass the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step 1, which tests their knowledge of everything they’ve studied up to this point.
This test is seen by faculty and medical school administrations as an indicator of a student’s ability to apply that knowledge to the practice of medicine.
========,3,Clinical Sciences (Year 3 and 4).
During this time, AUA students complete their clinical rotations within AUA’s network of more than 40 affiliated teaching hospitals throughout the United States, Canada, and India.
As of October 2015, AUA’s USMLE Step 1 first time pass rate is 97 percent.
Clinical Sciences curriculum lasts a total of 84 weeks and requires students to successfully complete core and elective rotations.
Students spend 6 weeks participating in foundational rotations in family and internal medicine before proceeding to 44 weeks of clinical core rotations in family medicine, internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, and psychiatry.
Elective rotations are then completed during the remaining 34 weeks and are offered in more than 57 specialties.
========,2,Supplemental Degree Programs.
========,3,American International College of Arts and Sciences - Antigua (AICASA).
========,4,Fast-Track to Medical School Program - AS/Pre-Med Degree Program.
Through a partnership with AICASA, AUA accepts AICASA graduates who complete the prescribed AS in Health Sciences curriculum and maintain a minimum cumulative GPA set by AUA.
All students matriculated in the AS in Health Sciences degree-earning program are automatically enrolled in the fast-track option.
========,3,FIU Global MD Program & Graduate Certificate Program - Core Clinical Certificate Program.
========,4,Graduate Certificate Program - Core Clinical Certificate Program.
In 2013, AUA and FIU created this program, allowing students to complete all of their core clinical rotations back to back at clinical sites affiliated with Florida International University (FIU) and under the instruction of FIU faculty.
In addition to the Clinical Clerkship Certificate program, AUA students have the opportunity to attend elective rotations at FIU.
Those elective rotations also include medical research projects.
========,4,Online MBA with an Emphasis in Health Care.
AUA is one of two medical schools that is partnered with Urbana University in providing an online MBA degree with a concentration in Health Care.
This course is entirely online, and students can take up to 5 years to complete but can be completed at 2.5 years minimum.
========,2,Financial Aid and Scholarships.
AUA currently lists 17 scholarships on its website, some of which are automatically awarded to qualified applicants.
They are categorized as academic, cultural, and service awards.
Eligible AUA students can apply for US or Canadian federal loans.
========,2,No MCAT Admissions Policy.
MCAT scores are not required and not considered part of AUA’s applications process.
The school’s “approach to evaluating students [is] holistic” and test scores are not part of any admissions decision.
Americans and permanent residents of the United States, however, are required to submit MCAT scores to satisfy governmental regulations.
========,2,Graduate Success.
AUA graduates have obtained residencies in competitive specialties like integrated plastic surgery, neurosurgery, pathology, anesthesiology, radiology-diagnostic, physical medicine and rehabilitation, ophthalmology, child neurology, and orthopedic surgery.
AUA graduates have matched at residency programs in the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Brown University-Rhode Island Hospital, Yale-New Haven Hospital, and Duke University in the United States.
In Canada, they have obtained residencies at McGill University, University of British Columbia, University of Alberta, University of Calgary, and University of Saskatchewan.
The majority of AUA graduates obtain residencies in the primary care specialty area.
