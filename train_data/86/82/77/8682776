The 1993 Kansas City Chiefs season was arguably the franchise's most successful in 22 years: The Chiefs won the AFC Western Division and finished with an 11–5 record.
Kansas City advanced all the way to the AFC Championship before losing to the Buffalo Bills 30–13, which started the Chiefs' NFL record 8 game playoff losing streak.
It would be 22 years before the Chiefs would win another playoff game.
The season marked the first for new quarterback Joe Montana, who was acquired through a trade with the San Francisco 49ers and running back Marcus Allen from the Los Angeles Raiders, both winners of five Super Bowl championships combined.
========,2,Offseason.
========,3,Montana and Marcus.
Kansas City acquired two Super Bowl MVPs with one fell swoop--Joe Montana from the San Francisco 49ers and Marcus Allen.
Allen arrived from Kansas City's most hated rival, the Los Angeles Raiders, in a move still talked about today when discussing football's most heated rivalry.
Leading into the 1993 season, the Chiefs had not only a proven passer, but also a proven running game to complement their already powerful defense.
The previous season, the Chiefs' starting quarterback was Dave Krieg and their running back was Christian Okoye.
Okoye suffered a knee injury prior to training camp in 1993, but keeping Krieg would prove to be a wise decision in the event of injury to the new starter Montana.
Allen was named NFL Comeback Player of the Year in 1993 after rushing for twelve touchdowns and 764 yards.
========,3,NFL draft.
With their first pick in the 1993 NFL draft, coming in the third round, the Chiefs' selected future all-pro guard Will Shields out of the University of Nebraska.
Shields went on to start 215 of the 224 career games he played for the team and was selected to 12 Pro Bowls.
