========,1,preface.
In Buddhism, a mental fetter, chain or bond (Pāli: "samyojana", "saŋyojana", "saññojana") shackles a sentient being to sasāra, the cycle of lives with dukkha.
By cutting through all fetters, one attains nibbāna (Pali; Skt.
========,2,Fetter of suffering.
Throughout the Pali canon, the word "fetter" is used to describe an intrapsychic phenomenon that ties one to suffering.
For instance, in the Khuddaka Nikaya's Itivuttaka 1.15, the Buddha states:
Elsewhere, the suffering caused by a fetter is "implied" as in this more technical discourse from SN 35.232, where Ven.
Sariputta converses with Ven.
========,2,Lists of fetters.
========,3,Sutta Pitaka's list of ten fetters.
The Pali canon's Sutta Pitaka identifies ten "fetters of becoming":
***LIST***.
As indicated in the adjacent table, throughout the Sutta Pitaka, the first five fetters are referred to as "lower fetters" ("orambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni") and are eradicated upon becoming a non-returner; and, the last five fetters are referred to as "higher fetters" ("uddhambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni"), eradicated by an arahant.
========,3,Three fetters.
Both the Sagīti Sutta (DN 33) and the Dhammasai (Dhs.
1002-1006) refer to the "three fetters" as the first three in the aforementioned Sutta Pitaka list of ten:
***LIST***.
According to the Canon, these three fetters are eradicated by stream-enterers and once-returners.
========,3,Abhidhamma Pitaka's list of ten fetters.
The Abhidhamma Pitaka's Dhamma Sangani (Dhs.
1113-34) provides an alternate list of ten fetters, also found in the Khuddaka Nikaya's Culla Niddesa (Nd2 656, 1463) and in post-canonical commentaries.
This enumeration is: 
***LIST***.
The commentary mentions that views, doubt, attachment to rites and rituals, jealousy and greed are thrown off at the first stage of Awakening (sotāpatti); gross sensual lust and anger by the second stage (sakadāgāmitā) and even subtle forms of the same by the third stage (anāgāmitā); and conceit, lust for existence and ignorance by the fourth and final stage (arahatta).
========,3,Fetters related to householder affairs.
Uniquely, the Sutta Pitaka's "Householder Potaliya" Sutta (MN 54), identifies "eight" fetters (including three of the Five Precepts) whose abandonment "lead[s] to the cutting off of affairs" ("vohāra-samucchedāya saṃvattanti"): 
***LIST***.
For English translations, see
========,2,Individual fetters.
The following fetters are the first three mentioned in the aforementioned Sutta Pitaka list of ten fetters, and the Sagīti Sutta's and the Abhidhamma Pitaka's list of "three fetters" (DN 33, Dhs.
1002 "ff".).
As indicated below, eradication of these three fetters is a canonical indicator of one's being irreversibly established on the path to Enlightenment.
========,3,Identity view (sakkāya-dihi).
Etymologically, "kāya" means "body," "sakkāya" means "existing body," and "" means "view" (here implying a "wrong" view, as exemplified by the views in the table below).
In general, "belief in an individual self" or, more simply, "self view" refers to a "belief that in one or other of the khandhas there is a permanent entity, an "attā"."
Similarly, in MN 2, the Sabbasava Sutta, the Buddha describes "a fetter of views" in the following manner:
========,3,Doubt (vicikicchā).
In general, "doubt" (vicikicchā) refers to doubt about the Buddha's teachings, the Dhamma.
(Alternate contemporaneous teachings are represented in the adjacent table.)
More specifically, in SN 22.84, the Tissa Sutta, the Buddha explicitly cautions against uncertainty regarding the Noble Eightfold Path, which is described as the right path to Nibbana, leading one past ignorance, sensual desire, anger and despair.
========,3,Attachment to rites and rituals (sīlabbata-parāmāso).
"Śīla" refers to "moral conduct", "vata" (or "bata") to "religious duty, observance, rite, practice, custom," and "parāmāsa" to "being attached to" or "a contagion" and has the connotation of "mishandling" the Dhamma.
Altogether, "sīlabbata-parāmāso" has been translated as "the contagion of mere rule and ritual, the infatuation of good works, the delusion that they suffice" or, more simply, "fall[ing] back on attachment to precepts and rules."
While the fetter of doubt can be seen as pertaining to the teachings of competing "samana" during the times of the Buddha, this fetter regarding rites and rituals likely refers to some practices of contemporary brahmanic authorities.
========,2,Cutting through the fetters.
In MN 64, the "Greater Discourse to Mālunkyāputta," the Buddha states that the path to abandoning the five lower fetters (that is, the "first" five of the aforementioned "ten fetters") is through using jhana attainment and vipassana insights in tandem.
In SN 35.54, "Abandoning the Fetters," the Buddha states that one abandons the fetters "when one knows and sees ... as impermanent" (Pali: "anicca") the twelve sense bases ("āyatana"), the associated six sense-consciousness (""), and the resultant contact ("phassa") and sensations ("vedanā").
Similarly, in SN 35.55, "Uprooting the Fetters," the Buddha states that one uproots the fetters "when one knows and sees ... as nonself" ("anatta") the sense bases, sense consciousness, contact and sensations.
The Pali canon traditionally describes cutting through the fetters in four stages:
***LIST***.
========,2,Relationship to other core concepts.
Similar Buddhist concepts found throughout the Pali Canon include the five hindrances ("nīvaraāni") and the ten defilements ("kilesā").
Comparatively speaking, in the Theravada tradition, fetters span multiple lifetimes and are difficult to remove, while hindrances are transitory obstacles.
Defilements encompass "all" mental defilements including both fetters and hindrances.
