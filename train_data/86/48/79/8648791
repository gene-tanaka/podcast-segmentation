========,1,preface.
The yellow-billed kite ("Milvus aegyptius") is the Afrotropic counterpart of the black kite ("Milvus migrans"), of which it is most often considered a subspecies.
However, recent DNA studies suggest that the yellow-billed kite differs significantly from black kites in the Eurasian clade, and should be considered as a separate, allopatric species.
There are two subspecies: "M. a. parasitus", found throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa (including Madagascar), except for the Congo Basin (with intra-African migrations) and "M. a. aegyptius" of Egypt, south-west Arabia and the Horn of Africa (which disperses south during the non-breeding season).
========,2,Description.
As suggested by its name, the yellow-billed kite is easily recognized by its entirely yellow bill, unlike that of the black kite (which is present in Africa as a visitor during the North Hemisphere winter).
However, immature yellow-billed kites resemble the black kites of the corresponding age.
========,2,Status.
It is mostly an intra-African breeding migrant, present in Southern Africa Julyâ€“March and sometimes as late as May.
It is generally common.
========,2,Habitat and feeding.
They are found in almost all habitats, including parks in suburbia, but rare in the arid Namib and Karoo.
They feed on a wide range of small vertebrates and insects, much of which is scavenged.
