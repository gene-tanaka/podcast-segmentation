========,2,History.
The SSAC was established by the Massachusetts State Legislature with Chapter 1009 of the Acts of 1971 as one of the first organizations to provide for direct student involvement in statewide decision-making in education.
Governor Francis W. Sargent filed this legislation stating, "If we are to replace confrontation with deliberation and shouting with dialogue, youth must be invited in, not shut out.
We have ... a climate where young and old can sit together, talk, and listen."
The SAC is composed of five Regions (that consist of eleven councils total (two for each region except for Greater Boston which receives three councils due to its large amount of representation) and the State Council .
According to Chapter 15: Section 1E of the General Laws of Massachusetts, every secondary school must elect two delegates to a Regional SAC.
Each Regional Council elects eight (Greater Boston elects twelve) members to the State SAC.
The State SAC has its own projects, but also helps coordinate those of the Regional SACs.
The SSAC serves as a communication network to share educational information among all students.
