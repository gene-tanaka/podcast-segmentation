========,2,History.
The club was sponsored by the Romanian Ministry of Internal Affairs (the "Miliția", Police).
In 1985 Victoria played for the first time in the Romanian top division, becoming very fast one of the most important teams, behind Steaua and Dinamo București.
Between 1986–1989 they finished every year in 3rd place.
However, it was a well-known fact during that time that many victories were due to unfair influences over the referees, other teams' players and even officials.
This is why in 1990, right after the Revolution, the team was dissolved by the Romanian Football Federation and the club literally disappeared.
The team was founded in 1949, in the neighborhood of Obor, being the branch of Dinamo București and promoted to Division B in 1953 under the name of Dinamo 6.
In 1957 became Dinamo Obor, in 1958 was named A.S. Pompierul, then again Dinamo Obor (1959–1963), Dinamo Victoria (1963–1967), then Electronica Obor since 1967.
Dinamo Victoria returns in Division C in 1980, becoming Victoria in 1985 when they promoted in the first division for the first time in history.
========,2,Players.
Victoria was known as a team that enrolled only good players, however not good enough to be enrolled by Steaua or Dinamo.
They were either players in their retirement age (such as Ionel Augustin, Costel Orac, Cornel Țălnar or Claudiu Vaișcovici) or talents not good enough for the "big 2" (such as Marcel Coraș, Ovidiu Hanganu, Ștefan Țîră, Marian Pană, Constantin Pană or Sándor Kulcsár).
Many players came from Dinamo (in fact, Victoria's stadium was a training field inside the Dinamo Sport Complex).
The Victoria Ground is known now as the "Florea Dumitrache Field" in honor of the Romanian striker, who played 11 seasons for Dinamo and 7 years for the Romania national football team.
========,2,European Cups.
Even so, during its short existence, the club reached one quarter final in the UEFA Cup 1988-89.
They were eliminated by Dynamo Dresden (1–1 in Bucharest and 0–4 in Dresden), a team from former East Germany, where Matthias Sammer was a young rising star.
