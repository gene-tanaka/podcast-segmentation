Ghosthouse (Italian: La Casa 3) is a 1988 Italian horror film directed by Umberto Lenzi and produced by exploitation film auteur Joe D'Amato.
It co-starred Lara Wendel and Donald O'Brien.
Its plot focuses on a deserted house where the visions of a ghostly girl and her haunted doll wreak havoc on those who enter it.
The film is the unofficial Italian sequel to "Evil Dead II" (released as "La Casa 2" in Italy).
In Italy, "The Evil Dead" was released under the title "La Casa", and "Evil Dead II" became "La Casa II"; these were followed by three other unrelated horror films, branded with consecutive titles so as to appear as part of a series: "La Casa 3", "La Casa 4" (also known as "Witchery"), and "La Casa 5" ("Beyond Darkness").
In the United States, "La Casa 3" was released as "Ghosthouse", with director Lenzi being credited under the alias "Humphrey Humbert".
