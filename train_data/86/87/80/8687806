========,1,preface.
The Twelve Collegia, or Twelve Colleges () is the largest edifice from the Petrine era remaining in Saint Petersburg.
It was designed by Domenico Trezzini and Theodor Schwertfeger and built from 1722 to 1744.
========,2,Description.
The three-storey, red-brick complex of 12 buildings is 400â€“440 meters long, giving an illusion of one enormous edifice.
The result is an "austerely structured" complex with a "rustic style".
The original design separated the 12 individual buildings.
In subsequent restructuring, they would be connected to form the modern complex.
