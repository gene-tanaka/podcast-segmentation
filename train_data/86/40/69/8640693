The answers will come on Christmas Eve.
========,2,Origin and alternative drafts.
"Firefly" was co-written and directed by Pete Marcy.
Originally conceived in 2000, "Firefly" was written backwards, with the ending giving way to the intricate build-up preceding it; once the skeleton of the story was in place, Marcy's brother Chris joined him in writing the rest of the script, filling out dialogue and characters.
Originally, the ending was to take place in a warehouse, with a struggle over a knife and a fatal gunshot, but Pete and Chris, along with the rest of the crew, thought that was "stupid".
"Firefly" began filming in November 2002 and finished post-production in June 2005, running 115 minutes.
An alternative, final cut was finished in Spring 2006, running 104 minutes.
Among the scenes cut out was one with the director's mother.
