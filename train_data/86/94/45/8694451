"Crash and Burn" was officially titled "Robot Jox 2" in most European markets at the time of release, but renamed when re-released on DVD.

The film was released on DVD by Full Moon in 2000, but was discontinued for copyright reasons.
The DVD contained a widescreen print of the film.
The film was later released onto DVD again through the Charles Band DVD Collection, released in 2006.
