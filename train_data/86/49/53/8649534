========,3,World War II.
The organization was initially activated in Hawaii as the 14th Pursuit Wing to contribute to the defense of the Hawaiian Islands.
Its designation was soon changed to Hawaiian Interceptor Command.
The Hawaiian Interceptor Command suffered heavy losses during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941), but airmen managed to shoot down several enemy aircraft.
A short time later, it was inactivated and its men and equipment became the cadre for VII Fighter Command.
The wing was reformed as the 14th Bombardment Wing, the unit was one of the primary Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy strategic bombardment groups of the Eighth Air Force's 2d Bombardment Division in World War II.
Its subordinate groups flew bombing missions against German airfields, oil installations, and marshalling yards.
Wing components supported Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy, in June 1944 by attacking strong points in the beachhead area and transportation targets behind the front lines.
Later, in December 1944â€“January 1945, the wing helped to check the German offensive during the Battle of the Bulge.
In March 1945, subordinate units supported Operation Lumberjack, the campaign to cross the Rhine River.

Reactivated in 1951, the 14th Air Division was an intermediate command echelon of Strategic Air Command.
The command provided operational reconnaissance, maintained round the clock radar surveillance to detect sea launched ballistic missiles from the Pacific Ocean area, and provided for crisis management during periods of increased operational readiness.
For a brief period, between 1962 and 1965, the division maintained a SM-68 Titan I intercontinental ballistic missile complex, in addition to its assigned aircraft.
The division also supervised all of Strategic Air Command's initial combat crew training for the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, Boeing B-52G Stratofortress and B-52H, Lockheed U-2, and Lockheed SR-71 aircraft.
It was inactivated in 1991 as part of the military drawdown of the USAF after the end of the Cold War.
