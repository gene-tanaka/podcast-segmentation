========,2,Background.
Dolphins are threatened marine mammals with close ties to human history and culture.
Living in oceans and rivers, their survival is becoming increasingly difficult.
Dolphins need clean and quiet oceans and protected areas.
With their variety of almost 40 species, dolphins are quintessential flagship species for their ecosystem.
An ocean in which dolphins can do well is an ocean where all other lifeforms can do well too.
The Year of the Dolphin was part of the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development.
The campaign was also a tangible contribution towards meeting targets to reduce the loss of wildlife by 2010 which all Governments have agreed through the United Nations.
========,2,Campaign.
The United Nations, member Governments, intergovernmental organizations, NGOs and the private sector (e.g.
TUI) are building a strong alliance to achieve a common objective: to protect dolphins.
<br> A crucial factor in achieving the protection of dolphins is to create awareness of dolphin species, educate, inform decision makers and involve local communities.
The main focus of the campaign was on educational activities and awareness raising.
The educational activities were aimed first and foremost at children, with numerous educational manuals, leaflets, posters etc.
being distributed to schools and young tourists, e.g.
through the network of YoD partner TUI.
Numerous NGOs also played an important role in the raising of awareness for the plight of the dolphins.
Some outstanding contributions were made by dedicated individuals, e.g.
a young teacher in Mumbai, India visited schools in his city, spreading the word on dolphin conservation to approximately 3000 schoolchildren, their teachers and, by extension, their families.
The YoD partners supplied him with educational materials and prizes to give to children who had made special contributions.
Kenya was certainly a hotspot of YoD activities, with a large number of educational events, the dedication of a boat to the patrolling of Marine Protected Areas and an exchange of old fishing gear for sustainable, dolphin-friendly gear, to name only a few.
The website features in-depth information on the almost 40 species of dolphins, as well as several outstanding conservation projects and articles on some of the activities undertaken in YoD 2007/2008.
A more complete view of the YoD's activities and achievements is given on the YoD website (see references below).
========,2,Patron and ambassadors.
The designated Patron of the Year of the Dolphin was H.S.H.
Prince Albert II of Monaco, who formally launched the year on 17 September 2006.
The Prince released a statement reading, "The Year of the Dolphin gives me the opportunity to renew my firm commitment towards protecting marine biodiversity.
With this strong initiative we can make a difference to save these fascinating marine mammals from the brink of extinction."
The YoD had several ambassadors, among them several swimmers and sailors, as well as the author of the book "In defense of Dolphins", a book highlighting the complexity and many fascinating aspects of dolphin social structure and behaviour.
It focuses on the definition of 'personhood' and the implications this definition has for the classification of dolphins as persons and their legal and moral standing.
The book's author is Prof. Thomas White.
