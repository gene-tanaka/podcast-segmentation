========,1,preface.
"Deadweight" is a single by Beck, taken from the soundtrack to the film "A Life Less Ordinary".
The song was nominated for Best Song from a Movie at the 1998 MTV Movie Awards, but lost out to Will Smith's "Men in Black".
The song can also be found (in lossy) on the deluxe version of "Odelay".
========,2,Background.
Beck recorded "Deadweight" with The Dust Brothers between "Odelay" and "Mutations".
It was released on the soundtrack to "A Life Less Ordinary" at the end of 1997.
In contrast with the buoyant, lively melody, Beck adds his own Gram Parsons-style hard luck lyrics about gambling, Las Vegas, and loneliness.
Beck has mentioned that this song was a part of his "Brazilian trilogy".
Unlike "Tropicalia", which is a bossa nova song, "Deadweight" uses its Brazilian influence more as part of a larger funky brew.
As Beck said in USA Today, "I'm trying to get to a place where this merging of styles is so fluent and natural that you don't notice the different snippets, a musical consciousness where there's no preconceived ideas".
An edited version without the noise breakdown coda was also put out as a single.
========,2,Music video.
The video for this song features Beck working at a desk on the beach, then he goes on holiday to an office.
He eventually ends up at a movie theatre showing "A Life Less Ordinary".
The video is intercut with scenes from the movie.
========,2,Music video.
This song has a music video directed by Michel Gondry.
It interweaves footage from "A Life Less Ordinary" with images of Beck, who lives in a paradoxical world.

In the United States, it charted on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, peaking at number 16.
