========,2,History.
Sandridge Rovers Football Club was formed in 1896 and were members of the Mid Herts League for several decades.
Changing facilities were spartan with the club sharing the old pavilion with the cricket club.
Subsequently teams changed in the rear room of the Village Hall which had just one shower until the formation of the Sandridge Youth and Sports Community Association which enabled the present day facilities to be built in 1967.
With the new facilities in place the club were able to be elected to the Herts County League in 1967.
Division Two was won in the first season and Division One in the second, which meant that the club started the 1969–70 season in the Premier Division, where the first team has been ever since.
The Premier Division has been won four times – in 1981–82 and 1982–83 under Doug Parkin, in 1987–88 under Alan King and in 1994–95 when Nigel Tester was manager.
The prestigious Aubrey Cup in which the club first played in 1967–68 has never been won, with just two appearances in the final – losing by 2–1 to London Colney in 1982 and by 1–0 to Oxhey Jets in 2003.
The only County Cup success has been the Intermediate Cup in 1981–82.
