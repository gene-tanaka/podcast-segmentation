========,2,History.
Claridon Township was settled in 1808 by Asa Cowles and Seth Spencer.
Claridon was originally named "Canton" then "Burlington" when part of Burton Township.
Early settlers relied heavily upon an agriculturally based economy, with included dairying, poultry and potato crops.
Several cheese factories were built in the township, including the Hall Cheese Factory constructed in 1863.
Other industries were blacksmith shops, carpentry shops, maple sugaring, and Nathaniel Spencer's chair factory (the oldest manufacturing business in the township, built in 1811).
A railroad was constructed in 1872, with a line running through eastern and northern sections of Claridon.
This aided in shipping butter, eggs, cheese and maple syrup to the other communities.
One of the oldest roads in Geauga County, Old State Road (State Route 608), runs diagonally across the eastern part of Claridon.
