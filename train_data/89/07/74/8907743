========,2,Plot.
Riki Fudoh's brother was killed by his father at the request of his yakuza organization.
Riki does not let his father know that he saw the murder take place but instead starts an organization that takes over his high school.
Riki's two personal bodyguards are a gun-toting female student and a hermaphrodite student who wields a dartgun with her vagina.
After Riki kills one of his teachers for not paying back a loan, a beautiful female teacher arrives.
When the teacher visits Riki at his house, it becomes apparent she was Riki's dead brother's girlfriend.
As Riki organizes assassinations of his father's yakuza organization, a new teacher arrives.
The new teacher is actually Riki's half brother, whom his father sent to kill Riki.
The teacher kills Riki's bodyguard and severely burns his hermaphrodite bodyguard with acid.
Riki attacks the teacher at his apartment and nearly dies, but is saved when the female teacher arrives and kills Riki's half brother.
Later that night Riki's father attacks the boy in the same manner he witnessed his brother being executed.
However, Riki is prepared and kills his father.
At his father's funeral, the only opposing yakuza boss who managed to survive an assassination, Daigen Nohma, shows up.
The two exchange words and Nohma pulls out a gun at the same time Riki unsheathes his katana.
The film ends as the two are about to duel.
