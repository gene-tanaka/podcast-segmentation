After having trials at New York City FC, Ivanov was not able to sign because he was still recovering from an 2-year long injury (torn ligaments).

Since joining the club, he had been a solid starter for Panathinaikos while manager Andrea Stramaccioni was in charge.
However, after Marinos Ouzounidis took over, he was no longer a first-team choice for the club, especially after the defensive mistake that helped Apollon Smyrnis open the scoring in the Greek Cup match between the two (Panathinaikos eventually won 4-3); instead, discussions within Panathinaikos were made as to whether Ivanov would remain at the club even as a backup for the first team or would be completely released from his contract.
