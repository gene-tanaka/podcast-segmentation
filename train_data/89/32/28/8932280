Evgeni Krasnopolski began skating as an eight-year-old at the Canada Centre in Metula.
As a single skater, he won three silver medals on the senior national level at the Israeli Championships (2004–2005, 2009).

In 2009, Krasnopolski teamed up with Danielle Montalbano to compete in pair skating.

They withdrew from the 2011 European Figure Skating Championships after Montalbano dislocated her shoulder during practice.
In May 2011, Krasnopolski was charged with deserting from the Israeli army.
The Israeli skating federation stated, "We've asked for clarifications [about his service], and if we would have gotten them immediately Evgeni would have returned.
The decision to let him stay abroad for training was a professional call made by the federation.
The soldier got the (right) impression that we are handling the matter with the IDF and that he could trust the federation".
Montalbano/Krasnopolski medalled at several senior B events in the 2011–12 season, and finished 11th at the 2012 European Figure Skating Championships and 17th at the World Championships.
They competed at several events in the fall of 2012, including a Grand Prix event, the 2012 Skate America, but missed the rest of the season due to injury; Montalbano broke her ankle in November 2012 while practicing a twist lift.
