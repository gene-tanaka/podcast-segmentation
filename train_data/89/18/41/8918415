This is a list of community council areas established in each of the council areas of Scotland.
Scottish community councils date from 1976, when they were established by district council and islands council schemes created under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.
The same act had established a two-tier system of local government in Scotland consisting of regional and district councils, except for the islands councils, which were created as unitary local authorities.
The Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994 abolished regional and district councils and transferred responsibility for community council schemes to new unitary councils created by the same act.
