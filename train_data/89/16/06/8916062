========,1,preface.
The 2008 United States Senate election in New Mexico was held on November 4, 2008 coinciding with the 2008 U.S. presidential election.
Incumbent Republican U.S.
Senator Pete Domenici decided to retire instead of seeking a seventh term.
All three of New Mexico's U.S.
Representatives (Tom Udall, Steve Pearce, and Heather Wilson) chose to retire from the U.S. House of Representatives in order to run for the seat.
Pearce defeated Wilson in the Republican primary.
Udall won the Democratic primary unopposed and won the general election.
Udall's win ended 36 years of Republican control of this seat.
========,2,Background.
In February 2007 Domenici indicated his intention to run for re-election.
By October 2007, he changed his mind, stating that because of the progression of a medical condition, he would not seek a seventh term.
Domenici also lost his chairmanship after Republicans lost control of the Senate in the 2006 Senate election, which may have inclined him against running.
On June 3, 2008 Pearce and Udall won their respective nomination contests.
========,2,Democratic primary.
========,3,Campaign.
After Domenici announced he was not running, Democratic Governor Bill Richardson was considered a leading candidate for the seat, but in October he affirmed his commitment to his presidential nomination campaign.
In October Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez entered the race for the Democratic nomination.
In early November five-term Democratic Rep. Tom Udall entered the race.
On December 7 Chavez withdrew from the race, saying "While I deeply appreciate all the support I have received, it has become very clear to me that Democrats should not be divided in the upcoming election."
========,2,General election.
========,3,Predictions.
In February 2008 CQ Politics changed the rating of the election from 'No Clear Favorite' to 'Leans Democratic' citing polls.
In June, Senator John Ensign of Nevada, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, considered New Mexico to be one of the top ten most competitive Senate races.
At the end of August, The Cook Political Report rated the race as 'Lean Democratic'.
At the end of September, The Rothenberg Political Report rated the race 'Likely Takeover'.
========,3,Controversy.
Domenici and Wilson were both being investigated by the Senate for their roles in the dismissal of prosecutor David Iglesias.
This may have affected Wilson's chances in the 2008 election.
In late October Pearce made 130,000 automated phone calls, which led Wilson to "cry foul."
At issue was Pearce's use of the phone calls to justify his opposition to the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) bill.
The Wilson campaign claimed that "Pearce violated House ethics by urging those he called to contact him through his official, non-campaign phone number or check out his official, non-campaign Web site."
========,3,Finances.
The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) attempted to defend 23 Senate seats up for election in November.
Committee chair Senator John Ensign identified the 10 most competitive Republican seats in June 2008.
He was asked about the two Republican seats most likely to turn Democratic, Virginia and New Mexico.
Ensign did not directly say whether the NRSC was considering walking away to work on other seats that can be won, but he said, "You don’t waste money on races that don’t need it or you can’t win."
Udall raised more than $801,000 prior to November 29.
Wilson had slightly less, including a November Washington fundraiser with Vice President Dick Cheney that netted $110,000, bringing her total to about $750,000.
========,3,Debates.
The candidates have agreed to three televised debates: October 15 on KOB-TV, October 18 on KRQE and October 26 on KOAT-TV.
The AARP will co-sponsor the second debate and the Albuquerque Journal will co-sponsor the final debate.
They will also appear together on Meet the Press in the fall.
