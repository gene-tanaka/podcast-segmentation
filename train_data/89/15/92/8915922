Michael Cone, Conley's primary opponent, criticized Conley for being too conservative, that "We've nominated a Republican in a Democratic primary."
Conley was a Republican but left the party due to frustration over immigration, trade, and the Iraq War.
Some have compared him to Republican Congressman Ron Paul, as Conley supported Republican Congressman Ron Paul in his presidential campaign.
Conley is considered to be a conservative Democrat.

Conley, who had switched to the Democratic Party from the Republican Party, was opposed by much of the Democratic establishment because of his controversial positions such as his vocal opposition to the immigration reform and same-sex marriage and his support of Ron Paul's presidential bid.
A number of prominent Democratic figures in the state, including U.S.
Congressman James Clyburn, supported Lindsey Graham over Conley in the general election.
Political scientist Bill Moore claimed “The bottom line is, by not paying attention to this race, they ended up embarrassed by what has transpired: a Republican getting the Democratic Party’s nomination for U.S. Senate and a Republican who comes across as even more conservative than Lindsey Graham.“
Graham had $3.8 million.
In fact, he’s spent more time on the campaign trail for John McCain than he has defending his own seat.
Conley only raised $23,628 during the campaign.
Conley was so unknown that even Graham admitted “Almost no one knows my opponent.
The Democrats really didn’t field a — make a serious challenge — in terms of trying to find an opponent for me.“
