========,1,preface.
Chlorophyllum molybdites, which has the common names of false parasol, green-spored parasol and vomiter, is a widespread mushroom.
Highly poisonous and producing severe gastrointestinal symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, it is commonly confused with the shaggy parasol or shaggy mane, and is the most commonly consumed poisonous mushroom in North America.
Its large imposing appearance and similarity to the edible parasol mushroom, as well as its habit of growing in areas near human habitation, are reasons cited for this.
The nature of the poisoning is predominantly gastrointestinal.
========,2,Distribution and habitat.
"Chlorophyllum molybdites" grows in lawns and parks across eastern North America and California, as well as temperate and subtropical regions around the world.
Fruiting bodies generally appear after summer and autumn rains.
It appears to have spread to other countries, with reports from Scotland, Australia, and Cyprus.

========,2,Toxicity.
