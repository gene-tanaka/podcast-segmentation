Tom Maginnis in Allmusic describes it as: "an effusive three and a half minutes of Stax-inspired R&B, buoyed by a sweet guitar lick from Ronnie Montrose of such quality that would make Steve Cropper proud."
Reviewing "Tupelo Honey" in "Uncut" magazine, David Cavanagh wrote of "Wild Night": "Recorded live in the studio (as all Morrison's albums are), it sounds intricately layered, highly sophisticated by 2007's standards, like speeded-up Steely Dan meets Allen Toussaint.
It's fluid but meticulous; ultra-rehearsed but effortless.
It promises a party to come."
"Wild Night" as originally recorded by Morrison was rated at #747 on Dave Marsh's 1989 book, "The Heart of Rock and Soul, The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever".
