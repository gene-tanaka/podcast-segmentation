========,2,History.
This is the oldest parish, founded in 1636, when the first French settlers inhabited the west coast near the present site of Vieux Habitants.
The name, meaning "Old Settlers" derives from the fact that many employees of the West Indies Company retired here and preferred to be called "inhabitants" to distinguish between themselves and the slaves.
It grew gradually as an agricultural area, famous for its coffee, vanilla and Creole gardens.
