***LIST***.
Very quiet fishing village with many houses for rent.
Low season is January to April, mostly tourists from North America occupy villas.
During summer time which is high season, tourists escape the tremendous heat in Mérida in favor of the cooler coastal breeze.
Prices for villas double in the summer.
Approximately 90% of the residences are either vacant or abandoned, the latter in a state of ruin.
Most properties are either for sale or for rent.
The beach which is part of the northern Yucatan peninsula faces northerly winds in the winter; as such the beachfront is mostly covered with washed up weeds and many areas littered with plastic bottles.
Population is quite friendly, petty theft occurs randomly.
