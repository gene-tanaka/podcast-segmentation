For a time McGhee worked for Conoco, working on a crew that made the first oil discovery on the Gulf Coast through reflection seismology.
He was awarded a Rhodes scholarship, gaining a doctorate in physical sciences from Oxford University in 1937.
Back in the United States he became vice president of the National Geophysical Company, where he managed reflection seismology surveys in Cuba.
On his return to Texas, McGhee found employment with Everette Lee DeGolyer's oil services company DeGolyer and MacNaughton, scouting oilfields and marrying DeGolyer's daughter Cecilia.
McGhee described Cecilia as "the most beautiful and richest girl in Texas."
In 1940 McGhee established his own company, the McGhee Production Company, and soon discovered a major oil field at Lake Charles, Louisiana, which made his fortune.

At the beginning of World War II McGhee was a member of the staff of the Office of Production Management and a member of the War Production Board.
Commissioned into the U.S. Navy, McGhee served as a naval air intelligence officer on the staff of Army Air Force General Curtis E. LeMay, for which he was awarded the Legion of Merit.
========,2,Diplomatic career.
Following the war he was recruited to the U.S. State Department by then-Undersecretary of State William L. Clayton, joining in 1946.

He served as U.S.
Ambassador to Turkey in 1952â€“1953, where he supported their successful bid for NATO membership.
While in Turkey, the McGhees lived in Alanya in an Ottoman-era villa they named "Turkish Delight."
McGhee was instrumental in dealings with the Republic of the Congo and the Dominican Republic in the early 1960s.
From November 1961 to April 1963, he served as the third ever Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, during the Kennedy Administration (later to be replaced by W. Averell Harriman).
President Kennedy had left this office vacant since January 1961 until McGhee, was persuaded to take the position.

In retirement McGhee wrote a semi-autobiographical novel, entitled "The Dance of the Billions: A Novel About Texas, Houston, and Oil" (1990), whose lack of success was attributed by his family to its puritanical tone.
His 2001 memoir was entitled "I Did It This Way."
In 1989, McGhee donated his villa in Alanya, Turkey to Georgetown University.
