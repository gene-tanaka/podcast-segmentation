The 1st Marine Division was stationed in the eastern part of Korea when in early spring of 1952 it was ordered to move to defend the western sector.
The sector, which was long and stretched all the way to the Samichon River, was a section of the 8th Army's Main Line of Resistance (MLR) known as the Jamestown Line.
On August 8, 1952, E Company, 2/1, began taking incoming mortar and artillery rounds from the Communist Chinese Army's 63rd and 65th armies.
A company-size Chinese Communist Force (CCF) struck Outpost Siberia, which was manned by PFC Ramón Núñez-Juárez and a squad of 15 men.
Núñez-Juárez and the other the riflemen fought off the enemy for nearly half an hour before withdrawing from their position.
Núñez-Juárez, manning a Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), was able to halt the enemy's advance long enough for the remainder of his squad to escape.
Núñez-Juárez was struck by enemy gunfire and died as a result of his wounds.

Núñez-Juárez was listed as Missing in Action and was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his heroic actions.
