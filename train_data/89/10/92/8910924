Osorio began his playing career with Deportivo Pereira in 1982, and went on to play for Brazilian club Internacional in 1984 before returning to his native Colombia a year later, ultimately retiring in 1987 at the age of 26 due to injury.
Nicknamed "El Recreacionista" ("The Recreationist" in Spanish) due to his unorthodox training methods, Osorio held various assistant coaching jobs before beginning his managerial career in 2006 with Millonarios, moving abroad the following year to manage Major League Soccer teams Chicago Fire and New York Red Bulls, leading the latter to their first conference title in 2008.
He managed Once Caldas in 2010 and led them to a league title, as well as managing Atlético Nacional in 2012 and winning numerous championships.
In October 2015 he was named as the new manager of the Mexico national team.

========,3,New York Red Bulls.
Eight days after resigning from the Chicago Fire, Osorio was hired by the New York Red Bulls.
The decision came after Red Bulls and Fire reached an agreement on compensation for Osorio.

However, in the 2008 MLS Cup Playoffs Osorio would lead the club to their first ever MLS Cup Final.
On the way they defeated defending Champion Houston Dynamo (4–1 on aggregate), and in the Western Conference final defeated Real Salt Lake 1–0, before falling 3–1 to Columbus Crew in the final.
In his second season with the club Osorio guided them to one of the worst records in league history, finishing with a 2-16-4 record.
In his two seasons at the club Osorio went 12-27-13, the worst mark in the league during that period of time.
The club also suffered an embarrassing set-back when they were eliminated by W Connection in the preliminary round of the CONCACAF Champions League.
Due to mounting pressure, Osorio resigned from his post as coach of the New York Red Bulls on 21 August 2009.

In 44 matches in charge, he recorded a record of 23 victories, 8 draws, and 13 losses.
