========,2,Professional career.
========,3,Dallas Cowboys.
Downs was signed by the Dallas Cowboys in 1981 as an undrafted free agent safety.
He was so impressive in training camp, that he became the third rookie in Cowboys history to begin the season as a starter, after free safety Randy Hughes suffered a shoulder injury during pre-season.
He was a playmaker from the start.
Playing against the Washington Redskins in the season opener, he intercepted a Joe Theismann pass in the first quarter, he had a stretch of three straight games with an interception and would go on to intercept a total of 7 passes, on his way to making the All-Rookie team.
During his career he led the team in interceptions twice: 1984 and 1986.
Downs was one of the best tacklers in the NFL, leading the Cowboys secondary for seven consecutive seasons (1981 to 1987), recording over 100 tackles for four consecutive seasons (1983 to 1986) and leading the team in tackles in three seasons.
His best year came in 1984 when he had a team-leading 7 interceptions and 93 solo tackles (with 3.5 sacks), and even though he wasn't voted to the Pro Bowl, he was named All-Pro and All-NFC.
The next year, he was named All-NFC again.
He served as team captain for the Cowboys in 1984 and 1985.
In 1989 with the arrival of Jimmy Johnson, he was released before the season started.
========,3,Phoenix Cardinals.
He signed in 1989 as a free agent with the Phoenix Cardinals, where he would play his last season.

Downs helped anchor the Cowboys secondary for most of the eighties decade.
