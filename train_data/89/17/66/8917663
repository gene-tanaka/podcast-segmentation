========,2,History.
On 8 September 1972 Norman began recording his second studio album, "Only Visiting This Planet", the first album in a projected trilogy, in AIR Studios in London.
"Only Visiting This Planet", often ranked as Norman's best album, "mixed his Christian message with strong political themes", and "was meant to reach the flower children disillusioned by the government and the church" with its "abrasive, urban reality of the gospel".
In a 1980 interview, Norman explained its purpose:
"Only Visiting This Planet" is the first part of the trilogy, and represents the present.
On the front cover, I find myself standing in the middle of New York City, with buildings and traffic pressed around me and my hand on my head kind of saying, What is going on in this life?
Is this really earth?, and the back cover is me visiting the site of a previous civilisation with its own monoliths, not skyscrapers, but amazing, architecturally sound structures just the same.
The Druids apparently constructed Stonehenge to help them observe or worship the sun, and their civilisation is now as dead as will someday be New York.
And I'm just standing there, looking around, wondering what happened to kill off this culture and reduce its entire recorded history to a few standing structures.
On 6 January 1973 Norman was one of three named as Best New Male Artist of the year by "Cashbox".
By February 1973 songs from "Only Visiting This Planet" had been recommended by "Billboard" for "heavy Top 40 airplay", and were being played on WVVS-FM, KSHE-FM, and WKTK-FM.
In 1990 CCM magazine voted "Only Visiting This Planet" as "the greatest Christian album ever recorded".
"Only Visiting This Planet" was one of 25 sound recordings inducted for 2013 into the Library of Congress National Recording Registry, that preserves as "cultural, artistic and/or historical treasures, representing the richness and diversity of the American soundscape."
A statement by the Library of Congress called the album "the key work in the early history of Christian rock," describing Norman as one who "commented on the world as he saw it from his position as a passionate, idiosyncratic outsider to mainstream churches."
After a tour of South Africa in June and the UK in July, and the release in July of his "Why Should the Devil Have All the Good Music?
", a songbook featuring some of Norman's songs from both "Upon This Rock" and "Only Visiting This Planet".
In the song "Reader's Digest" Norman sings the following verse: "Dear John, who's more popular now?
IÂ´ve been listening to Paul's records.
I think he really is dead."
(see Paul is dead) "Who's more popular now?"
makes reference to John Lennon's famous claim that the Beatles were more popular than Jesus.
The album features King Crimson prog-rock bassist and Asia frontman, John Wetton on bass guitar.
A three-LP boxed set containing the entire trilogy in their originally intended forms and titled "The Compleat Trilogy" (as mentioned on the insert of the Street Level reissue of "Only Visiting This Planet") has never been released.
