========,2,History.
========,3,1933–1990: Seaman's.
Julius Seaman opened his first store in 1933 after dropping out of the seventh grade.
His enterprise gradually increased to an annual $150,000 in sales and allowed him to send his two sons to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
"His big[gest] goal in life was that his boys would follow him and build up his business," Morton Seaman told Forbes.
Julius Seaman died at the age of 48 of a heart attack.
He left Morton, the elder son and college graduate, to help his mother save for the business, while Carl, still in school, worked at weekends and durng vacations.
In 1955, they spent $1,000 on the store's first ad.
It was a full-page spread in a local paper.
When sales tripled, the same week the ad was published, Morton decided to open a second store to reduce the cost of advertisement per unit.
By 1971 there were seven Seaman stores.
In 1988, Seaman's Furniture was taken over in a buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. for $350 million, burdening the company with severe debt.
Jeffrey Seaman, son of Morton Seaman, was 28 at the time, but he shouldered a large portion of the buying duties for the company.
He and his father developed an overseas program during Seaman's restructuring phase.
In February 1990, four months after the major financial restructuring designed to reduce the company's debt, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts replaced the Seamans with Matthew D. Serra, former president and CEO of the G. Fox division of May Department Stores.
========,3,1990: Founding of Rooms To Go.
After the Seaman father and son left Seaman's Furniture due to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts replacing them, they opened the first Rooms To Go in Orlando, Florida on September 7, 1990.
Rooms To Go's founding concept was the sale of furniture in whole room packages.
Furniture was offered in predesigned rooms, targeted at consumers looking to save both time and money, without sacrificing quality, when shopping for home decor.
