Kennedy Plaza (formerly City Hall Park, Exchange Terrace, or Exchange Place) is a rectangular shaped central plaza and the geographic center of the downtown Providence, Rhode Island area, it is situated between Providence City Hall and the Providence Federal Building.
Following a traditional colonial pattern, the Plaza has served as a transportation hub since 1847.
Today, Kennedy Plaza is bounded by Exchange Street ("Little Wall St.") on the northeast, Fulton Street on the southeast, Dorrance Street on the southwest, and Washington Street on the northwest.
Surrounding the Plaza are Burnside Park, the Bank of America skating center, and the mobile Haven Brothers Diner which has been driven into the Plaza and parked next to City Hall nightly since 1893.
On the east edge of the plaza sit the three buildings - One Financial Plaza; 50 Kennedy Plaza; 111 Westminster Street - that comprise the famous Providence skyline.
========,2,History.
========,3,Background.
Kennedy Plaza has seen many transformations and redesigns over the years; it has variously been known as City Hall Park, Exchange Place, "The Mall", and Exchange Terrace.
The Plaza has not seen a ten-year period without salient change to its appearance.
The primary uses of the site have traditionally been as a transportation hub and also as a recreational space; the two uses don't always co-exist easily.
The Plaza has also been the site of frequent events, demonstrations, petitions and orations in front of City Hall or the Court House.
The plaza offers a convenient space for audiences to attend speeches on the City Hall steps.
========,3,Transportation hub.
In the early 1800s, the A&W Sprague company established a horse-carriage line in Exchange Place.
The carriage took passengers to Sprague's Rhode Island mills and as far away as Connecticut.
In 1847, the first Union Station was built.
Its two tall spires fronted on Exchange Place and were the tallest structures on the plaza.
The statue of Ambrose Burnside stood at the plaza's east end, and the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial on the west end, in front of City Hall.
In the early 1900s, the Burnside statue was moved to its present location in Burnside Park.
From 1920 to 1924, the plaza was circled by trolley tracks.
During WWII, the United Electric Railway and The Narragansett Electric company (owned by Marsden J. Perry) put "trackless trolleys" into service by installing electric buses in 1943.
Employing what was then known as a “WAIT” station in the form of a loop, U.E.R buses served North Main St to Pawtucket and through the East Side tunnel to Thayer, Waterman, Angell, Hope, and Elmgrove Streets.
As federal funds became available in the late 1970s for automobile-free zones, all local bus-waiting areas were consolidated to Kennedy Plaza.
By the 1950s, the plaza became less central to city transportation needs, as the automobile became the dominant mode of transportation.
========,3,1938 Hurricane.
The Category 3 1938 New England Hurricane flooded the entire expanse of Exchange Place when it made landfall on September 20.
The storm surge hit just at the end of the workday; the water level rose from a few inches to waist deep, then to over 13 feet, with strong currents sweeping people off their feet.
========,3,1964: Kennedy Plaza.
Massachusetts senator John F. Kennedy spoke from the front steps of City Hall on Monday November 7, 1960, the day before he was elected president.
Kennedy spoke for 13 minutes to a crowd of about 40,000 to 50,000 people in the plaza.
Kennedy's speech was a campaign attack against Republican candidate Richard Nixon.
Emotions in the crowd were reportedly high, with many people screaming and chanting.
In 1964, after Kennedy's assassination the plaza was renamed Kennedy Plaza in honor of the late US President.
In 1983, mayor Vincent Cianci had the plaza redesigned as a central bus depot.
City bus stops on Washington, Westminster, and Weybosset streets were consolidated at Kennedy Plaza in hope of reducing congestion and air pollution.
1998 saw the addition of a skating rink to the plaza.
In 2002, the Intermodal Transportation Center, a $12 million bus station, was built in the center of the plaza.
========,3,2014 RIPTA hub rehabilitation project.
In Summer 2014, RIPTA began a redesign effort that changed the configuration of Kennedy Plaza, and included the relocation of current bus stop terminus points formally located at the Plaza.
The overall plan transformed the Plaza into a pedestrian oriented environment, where bus terminal locations were moved to the periphery of the Plaza and adjacent Burnside Park.
RIPTA has noted an 11% increase in ridership of the Statewide system.
In anticipation of the July 15, 2014 groundbreaking for the rehabilitation project, on July 12 going forward, Bus terminus locations were found along Exchange Street near One Financial Tower, North Fountain Street, Exchange Terrace along the Rhode Island Foundation Building, and on Sabin Street along the Rhode Island Convention Center, beneath the Omni Hotel Towers.
RIPTA announced on December 9, 2014, that the Hub would reopen January 17, 2015.
In 2016, to combat a growing reputation as a haven for drug dealing, vandalism, and prostitution, RIPTA hired a squad of unarmed private security guards to patrol Kennedy Plaza.
Today, Kennedy Plaza serves as the modern nexus of the state's public conventional-bus and trolley-replica bus transit services operated by Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA), as well as a departure point for Peter Pan and Greyhound bus lines.
Greater Attleboro Taunton Regional Transit Authority (GATRA) commuter bus service between Taunton, Massachusetts and Providence also operates out of the Plaza in the morning and evening.
Through RIPTA alone Kennedy Plaza serves over 69,000 people a day.
========,2,Notable speeches, parades, and gatherings.
On April 20, 1861, at 10:30AM the sidewalks were filled with cheering throngs, who greeted volunteers, of the first division of the First Regiment of Detached Rhode Island Militia leaving for Washington, D.C..
Colonel Ambrose Burnside, in command, had ordered the men of the first division to assemble upon Exchange Place.
A second detachment left from the plaza on April 25, 1861.
Crowds gathered at the Plaza when President Teddy Roosevelt spoke on the City Hall steps on August 23, 1902:
One of the features of the tremendous industrial development of the last generation has been the very great increase in private, and especially in corporate, fortunes.
It is not true that the poor have grown poorer; but some of the rich have grown so very much richer that, where multitudes of men are herded together in a limited space, the contrast strikes the onlooker as more violent than formerly.
<br> On the whole, our people earn more and live better than ever before, and the progress of which we are so proud could not have taken place had it not been for the up building of industrial centers, such as this in which I am speaking.
But together with the good there has come a measure of evil.… Under present-day conditions it is as necessary to have corporations in the business world as it is to have organizations, unions, among wage-workers.
We have a right to ask in each case only this: that good, and not harm, shall follow.

On March 7, 1914, Harry Houdini brought his show to American audiences and to Exchange Place due to the closure of European performance spaces during the World War.
Over 20,000 people filled the plaza, to watch him perform his new act in "a straitjacket escape made while dangling high in the air, upside down" hanging from the fourth floor of the "Evening News" Building formerly sited at 50 Kennedy Plaza.
The crowd filled the plaza expanse following Fulton Street.
In 1917, Houdini returned to Kennedy Plaza to perform his escape act a second time, as "80,000 fedora-hatted folks who thronged the streets".
On June 3, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson called for the nation to ready itself for war in Europe.
In response, Providence hosted a 6 1/2 hour World War I Preparedness Parade in response to president Woodrow Wilson's "call for preparedness.
"A review stand in front of City Hall and a gigantic human mosaic formed a "living flag" on scaffolding above the front steps, lined on each side with Civil War veterans.
Over 52,000 people attended.
On May 11, 1919, a World War I Victory Parade was held on Washington Street and Kennedy Plaza, which marched through what was a Victory Arch in the center of the plaza.
On top of the arch was a reproduction of the Hellenistic sculpture "Winged Victory of Samothrace."
The inscription on the Victory Arch read: "TO THE MEMORY OF THOSE WHO WENT FORTH AND RETURNED NOT WHOSE SOULS ARE MARCHING ON."
John F. Kennedy spoke on November 7, 1960, the day before he was elected president:
On other occasions, in other years, this country has elected Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents.
They do it when they make a decision that that party and that candidate will serve a great national purpose.
In my judgment and the responsibility ultimately is yours, in my judgment the United States will be best served by a candidate and a party who recognizes the basic issues of our time, and that is that this country has to go back to work again.

========,2,Sculpture and public art.
 Kennedy Plaza is home to three public art works.
The most prominent is the 1871 Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument which occupies space directly in front of Providence City Hall.
Dedicated originally in 1871, by architect Alfred E. Stone with sculptor-work by Randolph Rogers, it was moved during the City Hall Park/ Exchange Place transformation in 1913 to the center of the plaza, and returned to its present location in 1997.
Large bronze plaques on the monument’s base list residents killed in the war.
Another plaque honors Rhode Island's African-American veterans.
A dedication on a northeastern plaque reads ”Rhode Island pays tribute to the memory of the brave men who died that their country might live.” In late 2016, the Downtown Parks Conservancy of Providence started a fundraising effort to restore the monument and the infrastructure immediately around it.
A clock occupies space in front of the main doors of the RIPTA Intermodal Transportation Center.
The 1911 Providence copy of The Hiker (Kitson), is sculpture in the center island of the RIPTA facility berths, and commemorates the American soldiers who fought in the Spanish–American War, the Boxer Rebellion and the Philippine–American War.
The original 1906 sculpture by Theo Alice Ruggles Kitson is located at the University of Minnesota.
