Hasegawa's research also includes the political and social history of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and Soviet–Japanese relations.
========,2,Scholarship and influence.
========,3,The February Revolution and the Russian Revolution.
The first is on the Russian Revolution.
He published, The February Revolution: Petrograd 1917 in 1980.
Hasegawa later returned to the February Revolution.
He revised and updated the original book, reevaluating the role of the liberals as active participants in the revolution.
He has embarked on new research on a social history of the Russian Revolution, focusing on crime, police, and mob justice.
========,3,Russo-Japanese Relations.
Recent Russo-Japanese relations are the second area where Hasegawa has done research.
This research resulted in the publication "The Northern Territories Dispute and Russo-Japanese Relations" in 1998.
In these volumes Hasegawa examines the tortuous relations between Russia and Japan over the territorial dispute over what the Japanese call the "Northern Territories" and what the Russian call "the southern Kuril islands."
========,3,The End of the Pacific War.
The third area of research Hasegawa has conducted is an international history involving the Soviet Union, the United States, and Japan in ending the Pacific War.
He published a book, "Racing the Enemy: Stalin, Truman, and the Surrender of Japan" (2005).
Challenging the widely accepted orthodox view that the atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the most decisive factor in Japan's decision to surrender, ending World War II in the Pacific Hasegawa puts forward the view that the Soviet entry into the war by breaking of the Neutrality Pact played a more important role than the atomic bombs in Japan's surrender decision.
This view is in contrast to earlier critics of the bombing, such as Gar Alperovitz, who argued that US President Harry S. Truman's underlying objective was showcasing US military might, as a deterrent to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's ambitions.
According to Australian historian Geoffrey Jukes: "[Hasegawa] demonstrates conclusively that it was the Soviet declaration of war, not the atomic bombs, that forced the Japanese to surrender unconditionally."
This view received criticism.
The most balanced and spirited discussion on this book is given in H-Diplo roundtable discussion with Gar Alperovitz, Michael Gordin, David Holloway, Richard Frank, and Baron Bernstein.
James Maddox, Professor of History Emeritus at The Pennsylvania State University, and author of "Weapons for Victory: The Hiroshima Decision Fifty Years Later", was one of the most trenchant critics of the book.
