========,2,Competition.
The competition was developed by the WACA and EventsCorp and was loosely based on the FIFA World Club Championship in football (soccer).
The aim was to find the best one-day domestic cricket side in the world.
Sanctioned by the International Cricket Council, it was anticipated to become a regular event and expand each year with additional cricket nations being represented.
However, the popularity of the event did not take off and it was not held again in subsequent years.
