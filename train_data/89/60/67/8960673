========,3,Star One.
A multipurpose deposit account for personal customers.
Only a cash card is issued, unlike other more traditional banks which continue to utilize savings passbooks.
In place of the passbook the bank sends transaction reports monthly by post, as well as providing online banking services.
Customers can take advantage of ordinary savings account, fixed term deposit, funds, as well as foreign currency deposit.
One of the biggest merits of this product is that customers may make unlimited use of ATM without incurring a surcharge.
In Japan, depositors typically pay charges when using ATM after office hours, or using other bank's ATM.
But with the Star One cash card, those charges are paid back to the customer at the beginning of the following month.
========,3,Master Debit.
Tokyo Star Bank offers two types of card, Tokyo Star Credit and Tokyo Star Debit.
Tokyo Star Credit is s typical credit card, but Tokyo Star Debit is "Master Debit Card".
Customers can use it almost like credit card, but the money used is immediately withdrawn from the account.
So users need not worry about "credit-limit", as the card can be uses up to one's balance of the account (200,000 daily transaction limit).
