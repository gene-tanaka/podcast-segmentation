========,1,preface.
Northern West Riding of Yorkshire was a parliamentary constituency covering part of the historic West Riding of Yorkshire.
It returned two Members of Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, elected by the bloc vote system.
========,2,History.
The constituency was created when the two-member West Riding of Yorkshire constituency was divided for the 1865 general election into two new constituencies, each returning two members: Northern West Riding of Yorkshire and Southern West Riding of Yorkshire.
The extra seats were taken from parliamentary boroughs which had been disenfranchised for corruption.
In the redistribution which took effect for the 1868 general election the two divisions were redistributed into three.
Eastern West Riding of Yorkshire was created and the Northern and Southern divisions modified.
Each of the three divisions returned two members.
All three were abolished by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 for the 1885 general election.
The Northern division was replaced by five new single-member constituencies: Elland, Keighley, Shipley, Skipton and Sowerby.
========,2,Boundaries.
The place of election was initially at Leeds (1861 Act), later at Bradford (1867 Act).
From 1865 to 1868 the constituency comprised the north half of the West Riding of Yorkshire.
The Birkenhead Enfranchisement Act 1861 provided that it was to contain the wapentakes of Staincliffe and Ewecross, Claro, Skyrack, and Morley.
The Reform Act 1867 re-defined the constituency as the wapentake of Staincliffe and Ewcross, Claro, Skyrack, Barkston Ash, and Osgoldcross.
The Boundary Act 1868 again re-defined the constituency as the wapentake of Staincliffe and Ewcross with part of the wapentake of Morley (the parishes of Bradford and Halifax and the townships of Boston and Idle).
