The first verse is performed by three of the four members of the rap group Dramacydal who would go on to join 2Pac's Outlawz group (Young Hollywood, K-Dog, and Big Malcolm, in that order), the second by Stretch and the Notorious B.I.G., and the third and last by 2Pac.
Four of the artists on the song have since been murdered, 2Pac, Notorious B.I.G., Yaki Kadafi and Stretch.

========,2,Releases.
"Runnin' From tha Police" was supposed to be featured on Shakur's album "", but it was cut due to heavy criticism of gangsta rap at the time.
Subsequently it was intended to be featured on Shakur's album "Me Against The World", with a different 2Pac verse, in 1995, but was cut due to the shooting in '94 that would lead to his bitter rivalry with Notorious B.I.G.
Instead, it was released a year later, as a part of compilation album of original hip-hop entitled "One Million Strong", which also featured songs by Mobb Deep, Dr. Dre, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, Sunz of Man, among others.
========,2,Remixes and legacy.
In 1994, the Hip-Hop duo Ill Al Skratch used this sample for their song "This is for My Homiez" on their album "Creep Wit' Me"
In 2003, "Runnin' (Dying to Live)", a remix of this song produced by Eminem, was released as a single from the "" soundtrack.
This version vastly differs from the original, using the 2Pac verse from the Thug Life version, different melody, and not including the performances by Dramacydal or Stretch at all, instead having a sample of Edgar Winter's "Dying to Live" as the chorus.
The remix charted at #19 on the Billboard Hot 100, and arguably is now more known than the original.
In 2006, Ludacris used a sample of Notorious' first words in his verse ("I grew up a fucking screw up / Got introduced to the game / Got an ounce and fucking blew up") as a hook on his single "Grew Up a Screw Up".
